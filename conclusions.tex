\section{Conclusions}

In this study, we performed code-to-code verification on Moltres based on the
CNRS numerical benchmark \cite{tiberga_results_2020} for multi-physics,
\gls{MSR} simulation software. The benchmark assesses simulation
software through subproblems involving single-physics and coupled
neutronics/thermal-hydraulics.

The results showed that Moltres is mostly consistent with the other software
presented in the benchmark paper. The percentage discrepancies in the various
neutronics, velocity, and temperature quantities mostly fall within the same
order of magnitude. Minor deviations in the temperature in Steps 0.3 and 1.2 
stem from the discontinuous velocity
boundaries on the top corners in the lid-driven cavity flow, while minor
deviations in the flux and delayed neutron source in Steps 0.2, 0.3, and 1.1
stem from the zeroth-order shape function approximation on the precursor
concentration. The results from Moltres agree closest to the TUD-S$_2$ model
from the benchmark, which implements the $S_2$ discrete ordinates method for
neutron transport.
