\section{Conclusions}

In this study, we performed code-to-code verification on Moltres based on the
CNRS numerical benchmark \citep{tiberga_results_2020} for multi-physics,
\gls{MSR} simulation software. The benchmark assesses simulation
software through subproblems involving single-physics and coupled
neutronics/thermal-hydraulics.

The results showed that Moltres is consistent with the other software
presented in the benchmark paper. The percentage discrepancies in the various
neutronics, velocity, and temperature quantities mostly fall within the same
order of magnitude. Minor deviations in the temperature in Steps 0.3 and 1.2 
stem from the discontinuous velocity
boundaries on the top corners in the lid-driven cavity flow. We have shown that
these deviations are limited to the top boundary of the domain and they do not
affect the rest of the physical parameters. The results from
Moltres agree closest to the TUD-S$_2$ model
from the benchmark, which implements the $S_2$ discrete ordinates method for
neutron transport on a uniform structured mesh with a \gls{DFEM}-based solver.
These features make Moltres the most similar to the TUD-$S_2$ model as compared
to the other models which use different neutron transport models, non-uniform
mesh and/or finite volume method solvers.
