\section{Introduction}

This is the introduction section. For consistency, use the
\texttt{glossaries} package for acronyms such as ``\gls{SFR}".
This automatically populates the glossaries list and abbreviates future
mentions of ``\gls{SFR}".

All tables and figures must be referenced to in the text.
Use the BibTeX package to manage your paper references and bibliography
