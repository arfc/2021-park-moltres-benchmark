\opening{Dear Professors Ghiaasiaan, Ravetto, and Pozzi,}

Please find enclosed a manuscript entitled: ``Verification of Moltres for
Multiphysics Simulations of Fast-Spectrum Molten Salt Reactors'' which
Dr.\ Madicken Munk and I are submitting for exclusive
consideration for publication as a research article in Annals of Nuclear
Energy.

This manuscript describes Moltres, an open-source multiphysics simulation
software for molten salt reactors (MSRs) and other advanced reactors.
Built on the Multiphysics Object-Oriented Simulation Environment (MOOSE)
framework, Moltres provides highly scalable, fully implicit methods
for tackling strongly coupled multiphysics typically found in MSRs, while also
supporting segregated solver approaches where desired. In this work,
we verified Moltres' capability to model fast-spectrum MSRs by
accurately reproducing the expected solutions of the CNRS benchmark, a
multiphysics numerical benchmark designed to assess the physics-coupling
capabilities of MSR simulation software. Through the various subproblems in the
benchmark, our simulation results consistently show good agreement with
results from other software presented in the CNRS benchmark paper. This
verification work builds a strong foundation for future work involving
modeling and simulation of fast-spectrum MSRs with Moltres.

Thank you for your consideration of this work. I expect it will be of interest
to a broad readership, namely individuals interested in multiphysics modeling
and simulation of nuclear reactors; reactor physicists interested in MSRs; and
users of open-source simulation software to those ends. Please address
correspondence concerning this manuscript to me at \mbox{smpark3@illinois.edu}.

\closing{\hspace{3cm} Sincere regards,}
