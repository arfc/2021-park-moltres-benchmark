\opening{Dear Professors Azmy, Joyce, and Su,}

Please find enclosed a revision of the manuscript entitled: ``Synergistic Spent Nuclear Fuel 
Dynamics Within the European Union'' which I and my coauthors, Bae and Singer, 
are resubmitting for exclusive consideration for publication as a research 
article in Progress in Nuclear Energy. The review comments have improved the 
paper.

This manuscript describes multi-region, dynamic, nuclear energy system transition 
simulations using the Cyclus nuclear fuel cycle simulator framework and its 
modeling ecosystem. These simulations investigate and demonstrate the material 
feasibility of a collaborative spent fuel management strategy across nuclear 
nations in the European Union.  

These simulations are motivated and described in the context of relevant
socio-political dynamics in the European Union. However the focus of these
simulations primarily emphasize the technical challenges tied to material transmutation
and reactor deployment. We conclude that a collaborative strategy for spent 
fuel management in the European Union is technically feasible and could 
expedite a fast reactor technology transition in France.

Thank you for your consideration of this work. I expect it will be of interest
to a broad readership concerned with the nuclear fuel cycle, advanced reactors,
spent fuel management, and applications of agent-based and object-oriented
simulation to nuclear engineering.  Please address correspondence concerning
this manuscript to me at the University of Illinois.

\closing{Sincere regards,
