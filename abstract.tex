Modeling strongly coupled neutronics and thermal-hydraulics in the
liquid-fueled \glspl{MSR} requires robust and flexible multiphysics software
for accurate simulations at reasonable computational costs. In this paper, we
present Moltres and its neutronics and thermal-hydraulics modeling capabilities
relevant to multiphysics reactor analysis. As a MOOSE-based application, Moltres
provides various multiphysics coupling schemes and time-stepping methods,
including robust fully coupled solves with implicit time-stepping. We verify
Moltres' \gls{MSR} modeling capabilities in the context of a multiphysics
numerical benchmark developed at \gls{CNRS} for software dedicated to modeling
fast-spectrum MSRs. The benchmark involves several steady-state and transient
subproblems of modeling neutronics and thermal-hydraulics in a square cavity
filled with $^{233}$U-based molten salt fuel.
The results show that Moltres is consistent with the results from participating
software packages published with the benchmark.
Most of the discrepancy values of measured neutronics and thermal-hydraulics
quantities from Moltres fell within the same order of magnitude compared with
the published data. Among the
participating multiphysics tools in the benchmark,
Moltres agrees closest to the in-house multiphysics tool from the
Delft University of Technology due to similarities in the numerical solution
techniques and meshing schemes for the benchmark calculations.
