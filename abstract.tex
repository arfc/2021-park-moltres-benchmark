Moltres is a multiphysics application for modeling strongly coupled neutronics
and thermal-hydraulics in liquid-fueled molten salt reactors (MSR). This paper
verifies Moltres' multiphysics MSR modeling capabilities by presenting
results from Moltres in the context of the ``CNRS benchmark'', a
multiphysics numerical benchmark for software dedicated to modeling
fast-spectrum MSRs. The benchmark involves several steady-state and transient
subproblems of modeling
neutronics and thermal-hydraulics in a square cavity filled with U$^{233}$-based
molten salt fuel. The results show that Moltres is consistent with the other
software packages published with the CNRS benchmark. The average percentage
discrepancies calculated for various physical parameters, including velocity,
temperature, and fission rate density, are on similar orders of magnitudes
to the corresponding average discrepancies from the benchmark. Out of all the
participating multiphysics tools in the CNRS benchmark,
Moltres agrees closest to the in-house multiphysics tool from the
Delft University of Technology due to similiarities in the numerical solution
techniques and meshing schemes for the benchmark calculations.
