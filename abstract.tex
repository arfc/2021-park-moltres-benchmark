Modeling strongly coupled neutronics and thermal-hydraulics in liquid-fueled
\glspl{MSR} requires robust and flexible multiphysics software for accurate
simulations at reasonable computational costs. In this paper, we present Moltres
and its neutronics and thermal-hydraulics modeling capabilities relevant to
multiphysics reactor analysis. As a MOOSE-based application, Moltres provides
various multiphysics coupling schemes and time-stepping methods, including fully
coupled solves with implicit time-stepping. We verified Moltres' \gls{MSR}
modeling capabilities against a multiphysics numerical benchmark developed for
software dedicated to modeling fast-spectrum \glspl{MSR}. The results show that
Moltres performed comparably to participating software packages in the benchmark;
the majority of the relevant quantities fell within one standard deviation of the
benchmark average. Among the
participating multiphysics tools in the benchmark, Moltres agrees closest to the
multiphysics tool from the Delft University of Technology due to similarities in
the numerical solution techniques and meshing schemes.
