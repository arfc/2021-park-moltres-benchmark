	abstract = {This paper presents a multi-physics modelling (MPM) approach developed for the study of the dynamics of the Molten Salt Reactor (MSR), which has been reconsidered as one of the future nuclear power plants in the framework of the Generation IV International Forum for its several potentialities. The proposed multi-physics modelling is aimed at the description of the coupling between heat transfer, fluid dynamics and neutronics characteristics in a typical MSR core channel, taking into account the spatial effects of the most relevant physical quantities. In particular, as far as molten salt thermo-hydrodynamics is concerned, Navier–Stokes equations are used with the turbulence treatment according to the RANS (Reynolds Averaged Navier–Stokes) scheme, while the heat transfer is taken into account through the energy balance equations for the fuel salt and the graphite. As far as neutronics is concerned, the two-group diffusion theory is adopted, where the group constants (computed by means of the neutron transport code NEWT of SCALE 5.1) are included into the model in order to describe the neutron flux and the delayed neutron precursor distributions, the system time constants, and the temperature feedback effects of both graphite and fuel salt. The developed MPM approach is implemented in the unified simulation environment offered by COMSOL Multiphysics®, and is applied to study the behaviour of the system in steady-state conditions and under several transients (i.e., reactivity insertion due to control rod movements, fuel mass flow rate variations due to the change of the pump working conditions, presence of periodic perturbations), pointing out some advantages offered with respect to the conventional approaches employed in literature for the MSRs.},

The hot spot temperature is less than 10 °C above the average core outlet temperature and is located in the centre of the top wall of the core.

	abstract = {Molten salt reactors (MSRs) can be used as effective burners of plutonium (Pu) and minor actinides (MAs) from light water reactor (LWR) spent fuel. In this paper a study was made to examine the thermal hydraulic behaviour of the conceptual design of the molten salt advanced reactor transmuter (MOSART) [Ignatiev, V., Feynberg, O., Myasnikov, A., Zakirov, R., 2003a. Neutronic properties and possible fuel cycle of a molten salt transmuter. Proceedings of the 2003 ANS/ENS International Winter Meeting (GLOBAL 2003), Hyatt Regency, New Orleans, LA, USA 16–20 November 2003]. The molten salt fuel is a ternary NaF–LiF–BeF2 system fuelled with ca. 1 mol\% typical compositions of transuranium-trifluorides (PuF3, etc.) from light water reactor spent fuel. The MOSART reactor core does not contain graphite structure elements to guide the flow, so the neutron spectrum is rather hard in order to improve the burning performance. Without those structure elements in the core, the molten salt in core flows freely and the flow pattern could be potentially complicated and may affect significantly the fuel temperature distribution in the core. Therefore, some optimizations of the salt flow pattern may be needed. Here, the main attention has been paid to the fluid dynamic simulations of the MOSART core with the code SIMMER-III [Kondo, Sa., Morita, K., Tobita, Y., Shirakawa, K., 1992. SIMMER-III: an advanced computer program for LMFBR severe accident analysis. Proceedings of the ANP’ 92, Tokyo, Japan; Kondo, Sa., Tobita, Y., Morita, K., Brear, D.J., Kamiyama, K., Yamano, H., Fujita, S., Maschek, W., Fischer, E.A., Kiefhaber, E., Buckel, G., Hesselschwerdt, E., Flad, M., Costa, P., Pigny, S., 1999. Current status and validation of the SIMMER-III LMFR safety analysis code. Proceedings of the ICONE-7, Tokyo, Japan], which was originally developed for the safety assessment of sodium-cooled fast reactors and recently extended by the authors for the thermo-hydraulic and neutronic models so as to describe the molten salt reactors. For the adaptation to molten salt reactor, a complete equation of state (EOS) for this liquid fuel had to be developed and implemented into the SIMMER-III code. Through those simulations it was concluded that the thermal hydraulic behaviour appeared to be very important in molten salt reactors concerning design, operation and safety. A flow distribution plate design was found effective to optimize the flow pattern in the core region. Further investigations are under way to obtain optimal flow fields without exceeding design limits.},

	abstract = {The MSR (Molten Salt Reactor) is one of the six innovative concepts of nuclear reactors envisaged by the GIF-IV (Generation IV International Forum) initiative for the long term evolution of the nuclear technology, in the direction of a more sustainable, safe, proliferation resistant, and economic power generation. The MSR is characterised by a complex and highly non-linear behaviour, which requires a careful investigation, as a consequence of some unusual features like the presence of a fluid fuel and the drift of delayed neutron precursors (DNP) along the primary circuit. In this paper, the MSR primary circuit dynamics is analysed with reference to the MSRE (Molten Salt Reactor Experiment), due to the availability of both a detailed design and experimental data. Numerical models featured by increasing complexity are presented. In particular, a zero-dimensional model is developed, and two other models introducing a one-dimensional discretization for the DNP drift and/or the heat convection are also elaborated. These simplified models are then compared with a more complex model, obtained according to an innovative Multi-Physics Modelling (MPM) approach to the dynamic analysis, where the partial differential equations governing the different phenomena in a core channel are solved in a two-dimensional domain, within the same computational environment. A one-dimensional closure of the primary circuit is also provided. The MPM approach gives a unique insight into the influence of local effects on the overall dynamic behaviour of the reactor, while the variety of developed models allows a systematic investigation about the dimensional effects in the modelling of MSRs. This work represents a starting point in the set-up of a Multi-Physics (MP) simulation tool, suitable for calculations with different degrees of accuracy and physical complexity, and paves the way towards the development of MP models capable of a point-by-point coupling of all the phenomena characterising the MSRs, and the nuclear reactors in general.},

In this forum the graphite-moderated channel type MSR based on the previous Oak Ridge National Laboratory research is considered.
The liquid molten salt serves as a fuel and coolant, simultaneously and causes two physical peculiarities: the fission energy is released predominantly directly into the coolant and the delayed neutrons precursors are drifted by the fuel flow. The drift causes the spread of delayed neutrons distribution to the non-core parts of primary circuit and it can lead to a reactivity loss or gain in the case of fuel flow acceleration or deceleration, respectively. Therefore, specific 3D tool based on in house code DYN3D was developed in FZR. The code DYN3D-MSR is based on the solution of two-group neutron diffusion equation by the help of a nodal expansion method and it includes models of delayed neutrons drift and specific MSR heat release distribution.
In this paper the development and verification of 1D version DYN1D-MSR of the code is described. The code has been validated with the experimental data gained from the molten salt reactor experiment performed in the Oak Ridge and after the validation it was applied to several typical transients (overcooling of fuel at the core inlet, reactivity insertion, and the fuel pump trip).},

An accurate interpolation model developed to take into account the thermal hydraulics feedback on the neutronics including reactivity and neutron flux variation is presented.

	abstract = {The moderated Molten Salt Reactor (MSR) is an attractive breeder reactor. However, the temperature feedback coefficient of such a system can be positive due to the contribution of the moderator, an effect that can only be avoided with special measures. A previous study (Nagy et al., 2010) aimed to find a core design that is a breeder and has negative overall temperature feedback coefficient. In this paper, a coupled calculation scheme, which includes the reactor physics, heat transfer and fluid dynamics calculations is introduced. It is used both for steady-state and for dynamic calculations to evaluate the safety of the core design which was selected from the results of the previous study. The calculated feedback coefficients on the salt and graphite temperatures, power and uranium concentration prove that the core design derived in the previous optimization study is safe because the temperature feedback coefficient of the core and of the power is sufficiently negative. Transient calculations are performed to show the inherent safety of the reactor in case of reactivity insertion. As it is shown, the response of the reactor to these transients is initially dominated by the strong negative feedback of the salt. In all the presented transients, the reactor power stabilizes and the temperature of the salt never approaches its boiling point.},

This is accomplished with a flexible coupling capability that allows for a variety of different data exchanges to occur simultaneously on high performance parallel computational hardware. Examples based on the KAIST-3A benchmark core, as well as a simplified Westinghouse AP-1000 configuration, demonstrate the power of this new framework for tackling—in a coupled, multiscale manner—crucial reactor phenomena such as CRUD-induced power shift and fuel shuffle.},

	abstract = {Molten Salt Reactors (MSRs) were conceived at the early stages of nuclear energy in view of the favourable features fostered by a liquid fuel. They were developed as graphite-moderated thorium-fuelled breeder reactors till the seventies, when studies on this reactor concept were mostly abandoned in favour of the liquid–metal fast breeder concepts. A decade ago, the MSRs were included among the six GEN-IV systems and a core optimization process allowing for the GEN-IV main objectives led toward a fast-spectrum MSR concept (MSFR – Molten Salt Fast Reactor). Albeit advantageous in terms of U-233 breeding and/or radio-active waste burning, the new concept lacks the notable know-how available for the thermal-spectrum MSR technology. The present paper preliminarily investigates the MSR dynamics, based on the conceptual MSFR design currently available. A primary objective is to benchmark two different models of the MSFR primary circuit, both of them including a detailed and fully-coupled (node-wise) representation of turbulent fuel-salt flow, neutron diffusion, and delayed-neutron precursor diffusion and convection. A good agreement is generally observed between the adopted models, though some discrepancies exist in the temperature-field, with ensuing mild impacts on the reactor dynamics. The performed analyses are also used for a preliminary characterization of the MSFR steady-state and accidental transient response. Some points of enhancement needed in the MSFR conceptual design are identified, mainly related to in-core velocity and temperature fields. The reactor response following major accidental transient initiators suggests a generally benign behaviour of this reactor concept.},

	abstract = {Molten salt reactors (MSRs) have encountered a marked resurgence of interest over the past decades, highlighted by their inclusion as one of the six candidate reactors of the Generation IV advanced nuclear power systems. The present work is carried out in the framework of the European FP-7 project EVOL (Evaluation and Viability Of Liquid fuel fast reactor system). One of the project tasks is to report on safety analyses: calculations of reactor transients using various numerical codes for the molten salt fast reactor (MSFR) under different boundary conditions, assumptions, and for different selected scenarios. Based on the original reference core geometry, an optimized geometry was proposed by Rouch et al. (2014. Ann. Nucl. Energy 64, 449) on thermal-hydraulic design aspects to avoid a recirculation zone near the blanket which accumulates heat and very high temperature exceeding the salt boiling point. Using both fully neutronics thermal-hydraulic coupled codes (SIMMER and COUPLE), we also re-confirm the efforts step by step toward a core geometry without the recirculation zone in particular as concerns the modifications of the core geometrical shape. Different transients namely Unprotected Loss of Heat Sink (ULOHS), Unprotected Loss of Flow (ULOF), Unprotected Transient Over Power (UTOP), Fuel Salt Over Cooling (FSOC) are intensively investigated and discussed with the optimized core geometry. It is demonstrated that due to inherent negative feedbacks, an MSFR plant has a high safety potential.},

	abstract = {In the framework of the Generation IV International Forum (GIF-IV), six innovative concepts of nuclear reactors have been proposed as suitable to guarantee a safe, sustainable and proliferation resistant source of nuclear energy. Among these reactors, a peculiar role is played by the Molten Salt Reactor (MSR), which is the only one with a liquid and circulating fuel. This feature leads to a complex and highly coupled behaviour, which requires careful investigations, as a consequence of some unusual features like the drift of Delayed Neutron Precursors (DNP) along the primary circuit and heat transfer with a heat-generating fluid. The inherently coupled dynamics of the MSRs asks for innovative approaches to perform reliable transient analyses. The node-wise implicitly-coupled solution of the Partial Differential Equations (PDE) that govern the different phenomena in a reactor would offer in this sense an ideal solution. However, such an approach (hereinafter referred to as Multi-Physics – MP) requires a huge amount of computational power. In this work, we propose and assess a Geometric Multiscale approach on MSR, addressing the core modelling with a 3-D MP approach and the remaining part of the system – e.g., the cooling loop – with simplified 0-D models based on Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE). The aim is to conjugate the accuracy of the MP modelling approach with acceptable computation loads. Reference is made to the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE), due to the availability of a detailed design and experimental data that are used for assessment and preliminary validation of the developed simulation tool.},

Particular attention is devoted to the description of the adopted time integration and physics coupling strategies. The proposed model features the adoption of an implicit Runge–Kutta scheme and the coupling among neutron diffusion, Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes equations for mass and momentum conservation, and energy and delayed neutron precursor balance equations, in order to accurately catch thermal feedbacks on neutronics. The solver is aimed at performing fast-running simulations of the full-core three-dimensional Molten Salt Fast Reactor geometry. The neutronics modelling is assessed against Monte Carlo simulations and the results of a simplified case study are compared to those from multiphysics tools previously developed. As an example of the capability of the model, an unprotected MSFR single pump failure accidental scenario is simulated and discussed. The main purpose of the present model is to serve as fast-running computational tool in the phase of design optimization of fuel loop components. More in general, it is of valuable help in the study of reactor physics of circulating-fuel systems.},

It is based on the light water reactor code DYN3D and it allows transients simulation by 3D neutronics and parallel channel thermal-hydraulics. The neutronics and thermal-hydraulics were modified for the MSR peculiarities, where the experience from DYN1D-MSR development was exploited. The code was validated on experimental results from the MSRE experiment done in Oak Ridge National Laboratory and by the comparison with other codes especially with the 1D version. However, by the 3D code transients can be simulated, where space-dependant efforts are relevant, like local blockage of fuel channels or local temperature perturbations.},

The reactor physics part is based on diffusion theory, extended by a term representing the flow of the fuel through the core. The calculation of the temperature field is done by modeling all fuel channels, which are coupled to each other by a three-dimensional heat conduction equation. For the purpose of validation, the results of the MSR Experiment (MSRE) natural-circulation experiment and the thermal feedback coefficients of the reactor have been calculated and compared.
With the aid of a code system developed to implement this scheme, calculations were carried out for the normal operating state of the MSRE and some debris-induced channel-blocking-incident transients. In the case of the MSRE, it is shown that the severity of such an incident strongly depends on the degree of channel blocking and that high-temperature gradients in the moderator can connect thermally the adjacent fuel channels. Results are included for an unblocking transient (i.e., the debris suddenly exits the core, and the fuel flow reverts to the normal operating pattern), and it was demonstrated that during the unblocking large power peaks can be induced.},

	abstract = {Compressible fluid dynamics is of great practical interest in many industrial applications, ranging from chemistry to aeronautical industry, and to nuclear field as well. At the same time, modelling and simulation of compressible flows is a very complex task, requiring the development of specific approaches, in order to describe the effect of pressure on the fluid velocity field. Compressibility effects become even more important in the study of two-phase flows, due to the presence of a gaseous phase. In addition, compressibility is also expected to have a significant impact on other physics, such as chemical or nuclear reactions occurring in the mixture. In this perspective, multiphysics represents a useful approach to address this complex problem, providing a way to catch all the different physics that come into play as well as the coupling between them. In this work, a multiphysics model is developed for the analysis of the generation IV Molten Salt Fast Reactor (MSFR), with a specific focus on the compressibility effects of the fluid that acts as fuel in the reactor. The fuel mixture compressibility is expected to have an important effect on the system dynamics, especially in very rapid super-prompt-critical transients. In addition, the presence of a helium bubbling system used for online fission product removal could modify the fuel mixture compressibility, further affecting the system transient behaviour. Therefore, the MSFR represents an application of concrete interest, inherent to the analysis of compressibility effects and to the development of suitable modelling approaches. An OpenFOAM solver is developed to handle the fuel compressibility, the presence of gas bubbles in the reactor as well as the coupling between the system neutronics and fluid dynamics. The outcomes of this analysis point out that the fuel compressibility plays a crucial role in the evolution of fast transients, introducing delays in the expansion feedbacks that strongly affect the system dynamics. Moreover, it is found that the gas bubbles significantly alter the fuel compressibility, yielding even larger differences compared to the incompressible approximation usually adopted in the current MSFR solvers.},

	abstract = {The aim of this paper is the extension of a multiphysics OpenFOAM solver for the analysis of the Molten Salt Fast Reactor (MSFR), developed in previous works (Cervi et al., 2017, 2018). In particular, the neutronics sub-solver is improved by implementing a new module based on the SP3 approximation of the neutron transport equation. The new module is successfully tested against a Monte Carlo model of the MSFR, in order to assess its correct implementation. Then, a neutronics analysis of the MSFR is carried out on a simplified axial-symmetric model of the reactor. Particular focus is devoted to the analysis of the MSFR helium bubbling system and its effect on reactivity. The presence of bubbles inside the reactor is handled with a two-fluid thermal-hydraulics module, previously implemented into the solver. The void reactivity coefficient is evaluated on the basis of the bubble spatial distribution calculated by the multiphysics solver. Then, the results are compared to simulations carried out with uniform bubble distributions, highlighting significant differences between the two approaches. The outcomes of this work constitute a step forward in the multiphysics analysis of the Molten Salt Fast Reactor and represent a useful starting point for the optimization of the MSFR helium bubbling system, as well as for the development of appropriate control strategies.},

The MSFR can adopt a closed thorium fuel cycle for sustainable operation through the breeding of 233 U from 232 Th. The fuel composition changes significantly over the course of its lifespan. In this study, we investigated the steady state and transient behavior of the MSFR using Moltres, a coupled neutronics/thermal-hydraulics code developed within the Multiphysics Object Oriented Simulation Environment (MOOSE) framework. Three different fuel compositions, start-up, early-life, and equilibrium, were examined for potentially dangerous core temperature excursions during a unprotected loss of heat sink (ULOHS) accident. The six-group and total neutron flux distributions showed good agreement with SERPENT and published MSFR results, while the temperature distribution and total power showed discrepancies which can be attributed toknown sources of error. For the transient behavior under the ULOHS scenario, while the transition time towards the new steady state core temperature is also in good agreement with existing MSFR simulations by Fiorina et al., Moltres under-estimated the temperature rise by a factor of ten, due to the same sources of error affecting the steady state results. While an MSFR loaded with start-up fuel composition operates at a higher temperature than with the other two fuel compositions, all three cases were shown to be inherently safe due to thestrong negative temperature feedback.},

A completely coupled model is needed since in some fast reactors designs, the velocity pattern could be very complicated and strongly affected by the neutron dynamics via the heat source from fission reactions. Furthermore, the neutron dynamics is strongly affected by the thermohydrodynamics via the motion of precursors and by feedback effects. The methods typical of solid fuel reactors of previous generations are not sufficient to handle these more highly coupled concepts. In the preset paper, we consider the coupling between neutronics and thermohydrodynamics with simple but realistic hypotheses assumed to model the evolution of all the variables involved in the calculation. The numerical scheme used represents the current state of the art in the solution of non-linear systems: the Newton–Krylov algorithm. Several calculations are presented to demonstrate the ability of the methods described here to study the behavior of molten salt reactors in both steady state and transient situations.},

	abstract = {The molten salt reactor (MSR), which is one of the ‘Generation IV’ concepts, can be used for transmutation, and production of electricity, hydrogen and fissile fuels. In this study, a single-liquid-fueled MSR is designed for conceptual research, in which no solid material is present in the core as moderator, except for the external reflector. The fuel salt flow makes the MSR neutronics different from that of conventional reactors using solid fuels, and couples the flow and heat transfer strongly. Therefore, it is necessary to study the core characteristics with due attention to the coupling among flow, heat transfer and neutronics. The standard turbulent model is adopted to establish the flow and heat transfer model, while the diffusion theory is used for the neutronics model, which consists of two-group neutron diffusion equations for fast and thermal neutron fluxes, and balance equations for six groups of delayed neutron precursors. These two models which are coupled through the temperature and heat source are coded in a microcomputer program. The distributions of the velocity, temperature, neutron fluxes, and delayed neutron precursors under the rated condition are obtained. In addition, the effects of the inflow temperature, inflow velocity, and the fuel salt residence time out of the core are discussed in detail. The results provide some valuable information for the research and design of the new generation molten salt reactors.},

	abstract = {In this study, a hypothetical fast spectrum Liquid Fuel Molten Salt Reactor (LFMSR) core is modeled using the multiphysics C++ code GeN-Foam (General Nuclear Foam). GeN-Foam is based on OpenFOAM, a C++ open-source library for solution of continuum mechanics problems. The code utilizes a unified fine/coarse mesh approach, modeling different physics such as neutron kinetics, thermal-hydraulics based on porous fluid equations, and structural thermal-mechanics. A steady state analysis of a simplified two-dimensional (2D) LFMSR model has been performed assuming rotational symmetry to cross verify the code with the commercial ANSYS Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) code Fluent. The calculations showed very good agreement between the two codes allowing progression to a three-dimensional (3D) model simulation. A coupled neutron kinetics and CFD steady state analysis of a right-cylindrical 3D LFMSR core has been performed modeling one quarter of the core while using symmetry boundaries to reduce the computational time. Mixed uranium and plutonium chloride fuel has been selected in this preliminary study. Both 2D and 3D simulations showed appearance of recirculation zones within the right-cylinder core. These zones can be a challenge for LFMSR control and materials. A new hyperboloid design is proposed to remove recirculation zones, which is based on eight symmetrical loops. An Unprotected Loss of Flow accident (ULOF), in which the pump head is instantaneously reduced to zero, has been selected to demonstrate the safety characteristics of the reactor in one of the most challenging possible situations for LFMSR. The obtained results (e.g., reduced total precursors concentration at the core inlet and reduction of the core nominal power following the transient) confirm that GeN-Foam is capable of performing coupled LFMSR transient analysis and can be used for design analysis and optimization. Although the current design needs further assessment and development, it shows encouraging performance under ULOF conditions paving the way to the next step in the optimization process.},

These multiphysics phenomena include neutronics (N), thermal-hydraulics (TH), materials science, and other subjects. Among them, the interaction between neutronics and thermal-hydraulics is of great significance in reactor design and safety analysis. In this work, different N/TH coupling methods are reviewed, including loose and tight coupling. For the studies on loose coupling, in which two physical fields are decoupled, the current research status is summarized and classified based on the coupling methods of neutronics and thermal-hydraulics. The studies of tight coupling are introduced based on multiphysics coupling platforms. The investigation shows that the number and objectives of loose coupling studies are more abundant and extensive than those of tight coupling. This indicates that loose coupling strategies are the mainstream coupling solutions in recent research. Furthermore, the solution approaches of N/TH coupling are reviewed with respect to the aspects of performance improvement and application studies, including the operator splitting (OS), Picard iteration, and Jacobian-Free Newton–Krylov (JFNK) methods. A comprehensive study of the solution approaches shows that most of the current loose coupling numerical simulations adopt the Picard iteration method, because it has higher calculation accuracy than the OS method. In contrast to the decoupling approaches such as the OS and Picard iteration methods, the JFNK method updates all physical quantities synchronously, which makes it more accurate. Hence, there are broad application prospects for N/TH tight coupling of the JFNK method.},

	title = {Multi-{Physics} and {Technical} {Analysis} of {High}-{Temperature} {Gas}-{Cooled} {Reactors} for {Hydrogen} {Production}},
	copyright = {Copyright 2020 Roberto Fairhurst Agosta},
	abstract = {The future energy needs require the development of clean energy sources to ease the increasing environmental concerns. High-Temperature Gas-cooled Reactors have several desirable features that make them ideal candidates for the near-future large-scale deployment. Some of these features are a high temperature and high thermal cycle efficiency, which enable a wide range of process heat applications, such as hydrogen production. Implementing hydrogen economies can decarbonize the transport and power sectors, offering an alternative to ease climate change.
This work uses Moltres as the primary simulation tool. Although Moltres original development targeted Molten Salt Reactors, this work studies Moltres applicability to multi-physics simulations of prismatic High-Temperature Gas-cooled Reactors. Multi-physics simulations are necessary for assessing reactor safety characteristics. Ensuring
Moltres’ multi-physics modeling capabilities requires assessing the independent modeling capabilities of the different physical phenomena. Therefore, this thesis breaks down the analysis into three parts: stand-alone neutronics, stand-alone thermal-fluids, and coupled neutronics/thermal-fluids.
Regarding stand-alone neutronics, several analyses compare the results calculated by Moltres and Serpent on an MHTGR-350 model. The first analysis studies the energy group structure effects on the simulation of a fuel column. The results of the study suggest using a 15-energy group structure for attaining a desirable accuracy. The following analysis focuses on the full-core problem and compares different aspects of the simulations, concluding that Moltres obtains reasonably accurate results. The final study on stand-alone neutronics describes Moltres results of Phase I Exercise 1 of the OECD/NEA MHTGR-350 Benchmark. The benchmark exercise proved to be a modeling challenge, requiring the implementation of several approximations. For the most part, this thesis demonstrates Moltres’ capability to simulate stand-alone neutronics of prismatic High-Temperature Gas-cooled Reactors.
Regarding stand-alone thermal-fluids, several studies compare Moltres results to previously published results.
These studies focus on local models such as the unit cell and the fuel column problems, for which Moltres temperature results differ by less than 2\% from the published results. Further studies analyze the possibility of extending the thermal-fluids model implemented in the previous problems to a full-core simulation, finding a high memory
requirement imposed by the simulations. The full-core simulations focus on Phase I Exercise 2 of the benchmark, for which the implementation of a two-level approach in Moltres was necessary. The study’s temperatures were within an 11.3\% difference to the published results, concluding that further analysis is required.
Regarding coupled neutronics/thermal-fluids, the analysis describes Phase I Exercise 3 of the benchmark. The exercise uses a simplified model that helps visualize some of the essential aspects of multi-physics simulations in Moltres. This exercise finds some areas of improvement in Moltres’ model and sets a basis for future work.
This thesis aligns with the University of Illinois’ goals to reduce carbon emissions from its campus’s electricity generation and transportation sectors. This work focuses on two main analysis by introducing a nuclear reactor coupled to a hydrogen plant as a solution. The first analysis evaluates the conversion of the university fleet and the mass transit transport system in Urbana-Champaign to Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles. The second analysis investigates the duck curve phenomenon in the university’s grid and introduces a mitigation strategy that may reduce the reliance on dispatchable sources. These studies emphasize how nuclear energy and hydrogen production can potentially mitigate climate change.},

	abstract = {The effective delayed neutron fraction is an important reactor kinetics parameter. In flowing liquid-fuel reactors, this differs from the delayed neutron fraction because of the emission of delayed neutrons with a lower energy spectrum than prompt and the delayed neutron precursor (DNP) drift due to the fuel movement. In general, neglecting delayed neutron precursor drift leads to an over-estimation of the effective delayed neutron fraction. Nevertheless, the capability to simulate this peculiar phenomenon is not available in most reactor physics tools. In this project, a multi-physics approach to modeling DNP drift is developed using the GeN-Foam toolkit, and it benchmarked against available experimental data from the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE). GeN-Foam couples a neutron diffusion solver with a thermal-hydraulics solver. Additionally, a new function was added for solving adjoint multi-group diffusion eigenvalue problems and calculating effective delayed neutron fraction. For benchmarking, an R-Z model of the MSRE was developed in GeN-Foam. The porous media model was applied, and cross sections were generated using the Monte Carlo code Serpent-2 with ENDF/B-VII.1 nuclear data library. In order to evaluate the impact of DNP drift, two steady-state conditions (stationary and flowing salt at 1200 gpm) were simulated. A reactivity change of -241 pcm was calculated using GeN-Foam for the MSRE between static and flowing fuel, which is in a good agreement with the experimental value of -212 pcm. The total effective delayed neutron fraction change was calculated to be -230 pcm vs. -304 pcm reported for the MSRE and analytical calculated during the experimental campaign. Three transient accidents were also analyzed.},

Understanding the flow physics requires to consider pure two-dimensional flows, flows which are periodic in one space direction as well as the full three-dimensional flow. The topics treated range from the characteristic singularities resulting from the discontinuous boundary conditions over flow instabilities and their numerical treatment to the transition to chaos in a fully confined cubical cavity.

	abstract = {Advanced reactor concepts span the spectrum from heat pipe–cooled microreactors, through thermal and fast molten-salt reactors, to gas- and salt-cooled pebble bed reactors. The modeling and simulation of each of these reactor types comes with their own geometrical complexities and multiphysics challenges. However, the common theme for all nuclear reactors is the necessity to be able to accurately predict neutron distribution in the presence of multiphysics feedback. We argue that the current standards of modeling and simulation, which couple single-physics, single-reactor-focused codes via ad hoc methods, are not sufficiently flexible to address the challenges of modeling and simulation for advanced reactors. In this work, we present the Multiphysics Object Oriented Simulation Environment (MOOSE)–based radiation transport application Rattlesnake. The use of Rattlesnake for the modeling and simulation of nuclear reactors represents a paradigm shift away from makeshift data exchange methods, as it is developed based on the MOOSE platform with its very natural form of shared data distribution. Rattlesnake is well equipped for addressing the geometric and multiphysics challenges of advanced reactor concepts because it is a flexible finite element tool that leverages the multiphysics capabilities inherent in MOOSE. This paper focuses on the concept and design of Rattlesnake. We also demonstrate the capabilities and performance of Rattlesnake with a set of problems including a microreactor, a molten-salt reactor, a pebble bed reactor, the Advanced Test Reactor at the Idaho National Laboratory, and two benchmarks: a multiphysics version of the C5G7 benchmark and the LRA benchmark.},

When implemented as a consistent Petrov-Galerkin weighted residual method, it is shown that the new formulation is not subject to the artificial diffusion criticisms associated with many classical upwind methods. The accuracy of the streamline upwind/Petrov-Galerkin formulation for the linear advection diffusion equation is demonstrated on several numerical examples. The formulation is extended to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. An efficient implicit pressure/explicit velocity transient algorithm is developed which accomodates several treatments of the incompressibility constraint and allows for multiple iterations within a time step. The effectiveness of the algorithm is demonstrated on the problem of vortex shedding from a circular cylinder at a Reynolds number of 100.},

	abstract = {Numerical simulations of fast MSRs constitute a challenging task. In fact, classical codes employed in reactor physics cannot be used, and new dedicated multi-physics tools must be developed, to capture the unique features of these systems: the strong coupling between neutronics and thermal-hydraulics due to the use of a liquid fuel, the effects on reactor kinetics induced by the precursors drift, the internal heat generation, and the shape of the core having no fuel pins as a repeated structure. In this work, we present a novel multi-physics tool being developed at TU Delft. The coupling is realized between an SN radiation transport code (PHANTOM-SN) and a RANS solver (DGFlows). Both in-house tools are based on a Discontinuous Galerkin Finite Element space discretization, characterized by local conservation, high-order accuracy, and allowing for high geometric flexibility. Implicit discretization in time is performed adopting Backward Differentiation Formulae. Cross sections are computed on an element base, starting from the local average temperature and a set of libraries generated at reference temperatures with Monte Carlo or deterministic codes. Comparison of the results obtained performing a suitable numerical benchmark created at LPSC/CNRS/Grenoble with those available in literature shows that the multi-physics tool is able to capture the unique phenomena characterizing fast liquid-fueled systems.},

	url = {https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-03172978},
	abstract = {This thesis was developed within in the framework of the multi-scale and multi-physics models for the simulation of criticality accidents, carried jointly between the CNRS and the IRSN. A multi-physics and multi-scale approach aims to produce a numerical model taking into account all the relevant physical phenomena existing in nuclear systems as well as their coupling. This approach makes possible to improve the predictive capacities of the single physics models and to numerically study the behavior of a nuclear system under conditions that would be difficult to achieve or reproduce by experiments. The multi-scale / multi-physics approach is, therefore, particularly useful for the study of nuclear reactor criticality accidents, or more generally, for all nuclear systems where a tight coupling exists between neutronics, mechanics (of solids and fluids) and heat transfers.The objectives of the thesis were, firstly, to develop a new numerical scheme for the coupling between the neutronic code Serpent 2 (Monte Carlo code) and the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) code OpenFOAM. Secondly, to develop the physical models that allow greater flexibility for criticality accidents studies in terms of type of transients, systems and phenomena considered. Among the various physical models developed during the work, it can be mentioned the transient neutronic models based on a quasi-static Monte Carlo approach and on the deterministic SP1 and SP3 methods. A porous medium model was also developed during the work to allow performing studies on nuclear systems containing a solid nuclear fuel cooled by a fluid. The numerical implementation of the multi-physics coupling was performed in C/C++ in the OpenFOAM code. This code is very well suited to numerically solve continuous mechanics problems using a finite volume method. It also provides very large library of CFD algorithms (RANS, LES et DNS). The thesis work specially focused on the study of the strategy to be followed to implement the quasi-static method numerically with a Monte Carlo type code in the same platform through internal coupling.The performances of the coupling and the developed models were studied for different scenarios and nuclear systems: the transient Godiva experiments, an international benchmark for multi-physics codes for Molten Salts Reactors and the case of a hypothetical criticality accident in a Boiling Water Reactor (BWR) spent fuel pool. These diverse scenarios and systems were selected because they are characterized by presenting a multitude of highly coupled physical phenomena which required a very careful modeling. One can mention: the Doppler and fuel density effects, the thermal expansion and thermomechanical stresses, the presence of laminar or turbulent flows in the coolant or liquid fuel, the delayed neutrons precursors convection, and the energy and mass transfers and the phase change in porous media. The different comparisons between the multi-physics tool and the available data show a very good agreement and confirm that the selected approach is pertinent for the study of criticality accidents and allows obtaining very good precision and flexibility while maintaining satisfactory computational costs.},

	abstract = {The DALTON-THERMIX code system has been developed for safety analysis and core optimization of pebble-bed reactors. The code system consists of the new three-dimensional diffusion code DALTON, which is coupled to the existing thermal-hydraulic code THERMIX. These codes are linked to a database procedure for the generation of neutron cross sections using SCALE-5.The behavior of pebble-bed reactors during a loss of forced cooling (LOFC) transient is of particular interest since the absence of forced cooling could lead to a significant increase of the temperature of the coated particle fuel. Therefore, the reactor power may be constrained during normal operation to limit the temperature.For validation purposes, calculation results of normal operation, an LOFC transient, and a control rod withdrawal transient without SCRAM have been compared with experimental data obtained in the High Temperature Reactor–10 (HTR-10). The code system has been applied to the 400-MW(thermal) pebble bed modular reactor (PBMR) design, including the analysis of three different LOFC transients. Theses results are verified by a comparison with the results of the existing TINTE code system.It was found that the code system is capable of modeling both small (HTR-10) and large (PBMR) pebble-bed reactors and therefore provides a flexible tool for safety analysis and core optimization of future reactor designs. The analyses of the LOFC transients show that the peak fuel temperature is only slightly elevated (less than +100°C) as compared to its nominal value in the HTR-10 but reaches a maximum value of 1648°C during the depressurized LOFC case of the PBMR benchmark, which is significantly higher than the peak fuel temperature (976°C) during normal operation.},

	abstract = {A renewed interest has been raised for liquid-salt-cooled nuclear reactors. The excellent heat transfer properties of liquid-salt coolants provide several benefits, like lower fuel temperatures, higher average coolant temperature, increased core power density and better decay heat removal, and thus higher achievable core power. In order to benefit from the on-line refueling capability of a pebble bed reactor, the liquid salt pebble bed reactor (LSPBR) is proposed. This is a high temperature pebble bed reactor with a fuel design similar to existing HTRs, but using a liquid-salt as coolant. In this paper, the selection criteria for the liquid-salt coolant are described. Based on its neutronic properties, LiF–BeF2 (flibe) was selected for the LSPBR. Two designs of the LSPBR were considered: a cylindrical core and an annular core with a graphite inner reflector. Coupled neutronic thermal-hydraulic calculations were performed to obtain the steady state power distribution and the corresponding fuel temperature distribution. Calculations were performed to investigate the decay heat removal capability in a protected loss-of-forced cooling accident. The maximum allowable power that can be produced with the LSPBR is hereby determined.},

	abstract = {Harnessing modern parallel computing resources to achieve complex multiphysics simulations is a daunting task. The Multiphysics Object Oriented Simulation Environment (MOOSE) aims to enable such development by providing simplified interfaces for specification of partial differential equations, boundary conditions, material properties, and all aspects of a simulation without the need to consider the parallel, adaptive, nonlinear, finite element solve that is handled internally. Through the use of interfaces and inheritance, each portion of a simulation becomes reusable and composable in a manner that allows disparate research groups to share code and create an ecosystem of growing capability that lowers the barrier for the creation of multiphysics simulation codes. Included within the framework is a unique capability for building multiscale, multiphysics simulations through simultaneous execution of multiple sub-applications with data transfers between the scales. Other capabilities include automatic differentiation, scaling to a large number of processors, hybrid parallelism, and mesh adaptivity. To date, MOOSE-based applications have been created in areas of science and engineering such as nuclear physics, geothermal science, magneto-hydrodynamics, seismic events, compressible and incompressible fluid flow, microstructure evolution, and advanced manufacturing processes.},

As part of this project, a new solver has been developed for the eigenvalue and transient solution of multi-group diffusion equations. Several features distinguish the developed solver from other available codes, in particular: object oriented programming to ease code modiﬁcation and maintenance; modern parallel computing capabilities; use of general unstructured meshes; possibility of mesh deformation; cell-wise parametrization of cross-sections; and arbitrary energy group structure. In addition, the solver is integrated into the GeN-Foam multi-physics solver. The general features of the solver and its integration with GeN-Foam have already been presented in previous publications. The present paper describes the diffusion solver in more details and provides an overview of new features recently implemented, including the use of acceleration techniques and discontinuity factors. In addition, a code veriﬁcation is performed through a comparison with Monte Carlo results for both a thermal and a fast reactor system.},

The developed tool includes a solver for the eigenvalue and transient solution of multi-group neutron diffusion equations. Although frequently used in reactor analysis, the diffusion theory shows some limitations for core conﬁgurations involving strong anisotropies, which is the case for the CROCUS research reactor at the EPFL. The use of an SP3 approximation to neutron transport can often lead to visible improvements in a code predictive capabilities, especially for one-directional anisotropies, with acceptable added computational cost vs diffusion. Following some modelling issues for the CROCUS reactor, and in order to improve the GeN-Foam modelling capabilities, the GeN-Foam diffusion solver has been extended to allow for SP3 analyses. The present paper describes such extension and a preliminary veriﬁcation using a minicore PWR benchmark. The newly developed solver is then applied to the analysis of the CROCUS experimental reactor and results are compared to Monte Carlo calculations, as well as to the results of the diffusion solver.},

Traditionally, these feedbacks were evaluated via uniform radial and axial expansions based on average diagrid and fuel temperatures, respectively. The resulting smearing of the neutronic effects entails some limitations in terms of representation of local effects and overall accuracy. In addition, the thermo-mechanical behavior of a core is a complex phenomenon that cannot be reduced to simple uniform axial and radial expansions. Common examples of complex deformation patterns are the core compaction and the core flowering, which are known to have potentially dramatic impacts on core safety. In this paper, a model is developed that allows for a detailed thermo-mechanical analysis of the core, and that is capable of using this information for a locally detailed deformation of the geometry employed in the neutronic model. The capabilities of the model are discussed, together with its present limitations and some needs for improvements.},

	title = {Kinetics and cross-section developments for analyses of reactor transmutation concepts with {SIMMER}},
	abstract = {SIMMER is a coupled (neutronics, thermal-hydraulics, structure) code for nuclear reactor safety studies. The paper is devoted to recent neutronics, in particular kinetics and cross-section preparation developments, which were performed at FZK to extend the code capabilities to analyses of reactor transmutation concepts. In the first part of the paper, a spatial kinetics model based on the improved quasistatic scheme, which takes into account an external neutron source and movement of delayed neutron precursors, is presented. For flux shape recalculations, the precursor term is split into two terms: a "standard" term, which is computed in the neutronics part of the code similar to the solid fuel case, and a "movable" term that is computed in the thermal-hydraulics part of the code on the basis of the "standard" term. The space-time factorization is applied to the flux and to the "standard" term, but a weighting procedure is employed for computing the effective "movable" term in the point-kinetics part of the quasistatic scheme. The latter term is treated as an additional "effective source". At steady-state conditions in a critical system with movable fuel, the reactivity is positive and the "effective source" is negative, just opposite to a system with an external neutron source and solid fuel. The reactivity and effective delayed neutron fraction are computed independently upon the fuel flow rate during the transient. In the second part of the paper, a new code and data system for generating multigroup cross-section libraries for SIMMER is described. The system is based on a fine-group "master" library in the extended (to take properly into account neutron scattering at low energies) CCCC (ISOTXS and BRKOXS) format. The fine energy group structure is chosen so that this library and corresponding point-wise cross-sections give quite similar criticality values for a wide range of simplified reactor models, which can be potentially used for nuclear waste burning. Problem-oriented libraries in the extended CCCC format with a smaller number of groups and nuclides (a "steel" nuclide can be employed instead of Fe, Cr, and Ni isotopes) can be generated on the basis of the master library. It is shown that for a molten salt system without graphite moderator, the upper boundary of the energy region, in which the neutron upscattering treatment is important, is higher than in conventional light-water reactors.},
