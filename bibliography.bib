	abstract = {This paper presents a multi-physics modelling (MPM) approach developed for the study of the dynamics of the Molten Salt Reactor (MSR), which has been reconsidered as one of the future nuclear power plants in the framework of the Generation IV International Forum for its several potentialities. The proposed multi-physics modelling is aimed at the description of the coupling between heat transfer, fluid dynamics and neutronics characteristics in a typical MSR core channel, taking into account the spatial effects of the most relevant physical quantities. In particular, as far as molten salt thermo-hydrodynamics is concerned, Navier–Stokes equations are used with the turbulence treatment according to the RANS (Reynolds Averaged Navier–Stokes) scheme, while the heat transfer is taken into account through the energy balance equations for the fuel salt and the graphite. As far as neutronics is concerned, the two-group diffusion theory is adopted, where the group constants (computed by means of the neutron transport code NEWT of SCALE 5.1) are included into the model in order to describe the neutron flux and the delayed neutron precursor distributions, the system time constants, and the temperature feedback effects of both graphite and fuel salt. The developed MPM approach is implemented in the unified simulation environment offered by COMSOL Multiphysics®, and is applied to study the behaviour of the system in steady-state conditions and under several transients (i.e., reactivity insertion due to control rod movements, fuel mass flow rate variations due to the change of the pump working conditions, presence of periodic perturbations), pointing out some advantages offered with respect to the conventional approaches employed in literature for the MSRs.},

An innovative neutronic approach called “Transient Fission Matrix” is used to perform spatial kinetic calculations with a reduced computational cost through a pre-calculation of the Monte Carlo spatial and temporal response of the system. Coupled to this neutronic approach, the Computational Fluid Dynamics code OpenFOAM is used to model the complex flow pattern in the core. An accurate interpolation model developed to take into account the thermal hydraulics feedback on the neutronics including reactivity and neutron flux variation is presented. Finally different transient studies of the reactor in normal and accidental operating conditions are detailed such as reactivity insertion and load following capacities. The results of these studies illustrate the excellent behavior of the MSFR during such transients.},

	abstract = {The moderated Molten Salt Reactor (MSR) is an attractive breeder reactor. However, the temperature feedback coefficient of such a system can be positive due to the contribution of the moderator, an effect that can only be avoided with special measures. A previous study (Nagy et al., 2010) aimed to find a core design that is a breeder and has negative overall temperature feedback coefficient. In this paper, a coupled calculation scheme, which includes the reactor physics, heat transfer and fluid dynamics calculations is introduced. It is used both for steady-state and for dynamic calculations to evaluate the safety of the core design which was selected from the results of the previous study. The calculated feedback coefficients on the salt and graphite temperatures, power and uranium concentration prove that the core design derived in the previous optimization study is safe because the temperature feedback coefficient of the core and of the power is sufficiently negative. Transient calculations are performed to show the inherent safety of the reactor in case of reactivity insertion. As it is shown, the response of the reactor to these transients is initially dominated by the strong negative feedback of the salt. In all the presented transients, the reactor power stabilizes and the temperature of the salt never approaches its boiling point.},

Historically, simulation of an entire reactor was accomplished by linking together multiple existing codes that each simulated a subset of the relevant multiphysics phenomena. Recent advances in the MOOSE (Multiphysics Object Oriented Simulation Environment) framework have enabled a new approach: multiple domain-specific applications, all built on the same software framework, are efficiently linked to create a cohesive application. This is accomplished with a flexible coupling capability that allows for a variety of different data exchanges to occur simultaneously on high performance parallel computational hardware. Examples based on the KAIST-3A benchmark core, as well as a simplified Westinghouse AP-1000 configuration, demonstrate the power of this new framework for tackling—in a coupled, multiscale manner—crucial reactor phenomena such as CRUD-induced power shift and fuel shuffle.},

	abstract = {Molten Salt Reactors (MSRs) were conceived at the early stages of nuclear energy in view of the favourable features fostered by a liquid fuel. They were developed as graphite-moderated thorium-fuelled breeder reactors till the seventies, when studies on this reactor concept were mostly abandoned in favour of the liquid–metal fast breeder concepts. A decade ago, the MSRs were included among the six GEN-IV systems and a core optimization process allowing for the GEN-IV main objectives led toward a fast-spectrum MSR concept (MSFR – Molten Salt Fast Reactor). Albeit advantageous in terms of U-233 breeding and/or radio-active waste burning, the new concept lacks the notable know-how available for the thermal-spectrum MSR technology. The present paper preliminarily investigates the MSR dynamics, based on the conceptual MSFR design currently available. A primary objective is to benchmark two different models of the MSFR primary circuit, both of them including a detailed and fully-coupled (node-wise) representation of turbulent fuel-salt flow, neutron diffusion, and delayed-neutron precursor diffusion and convection. A good agreement is generally observed between the adopted models, though some discrepancies exist in the temperature-field, with ensuing mild impacts on the reactor dynamics. The performed analyses are also used for a preliminary characterization of the MSFR steady-state and accidental transient response. Some points of enhancement needed in the MSFR conceptual design are identified, mainly related to in-core velocity and temperature fields. The reactor response following major accidental transient initiators suggests a generally benign behaviour of this reactor concept.},

	abstract = {In the framework of the Generation IV International Forum (GIF-IV), six innovative concepts of nuclear reactors have been proposed as suitable to guarantee a safe, sustainable and proliferation resistant source of nuclear energy. Among these reactors, a peculiar role is played by the Molten Salt Reactor (MSR), which is the only one with a liquid and circulating fuel. This feature leads to a complex and highly coupled behaviour, which requires careful investigations, as a consequence of some unusual features like the drift of Delayed Neutron Precursors (DNP) along the primary circuit and heat transfer with a heat-generating fluid. The inherently coupled dynamics of the MSRs asks for innovative approaches to perform reliable transient analyses. The node-wise implicitly-coupled solution of the Partial Differential Equations (PDE) that govern the different phenomena in a reactor would offer in this sense an ideal solution. However, such an approach (hereinafter referred to as Multi-Physics – MP) requires a huge amount of computational power. In this work, we propose and assess a Geometric Multiscale approach on MSR, addressing the core modelling with a 3-D MP approach and the remaining part of the system – e.g., the cooling loop – with simplified 0-D models based on Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE). The aim is to conjugate the accuracy of the MP modelling approach with acceptable computation loads. Reference is made to the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE), due to the availability of a detailed design and experimental data that are used for assessment and preliminary validation of the developed simulation tool.},

The proposed model features the adoption of an implicit Runge–Kutta scheme and the coupling among neutron diffusion, Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes equations for mass and momentum conservation, and energy and delayed neutron precursor balance equations, in order to accurately catch thermal feedbacks on neutronics. The solver is aimed at performing fast-running simulations of the full-core three-dimensional Molten Salt Fast Reactor geometry. The neutronics modelling is assessed against Monte Carlo simulations and the results of a simplified case study are compared to those from multiphysics tools previously developed. As an example of the capability of the model, an unprotected MSFR single pump failure accidental scenario is simulated and discussed. The main purpose of the present model is to serve as fast-running computational tool in the phase of design optimization of fuel loop components.

The reactor physics part is based on diffusion theory, extended by a term representing the flow of the fuel through the core. The calculation of the temperature field is done by modeling all fuel channels, which are coupled to each other by a three-dimensional heat conduction equation. For the purpose of validation, the results of the MSR Experiment (MSRE) natural-circulation experiment and the thermal feedback coefficients of the reactor have been calculated and compared.
With the aid of a code system developed to implement this scheme, calculations were carried out for the normal operating state of the MSRE and some debris-induced channel-blocking-incident transients. In the case of the MSRE, it is shown that the severity of such an incident strongly depends on the degree of channel blocking and that high-temperature gradients in the moderator can connect thermally the adjacent fuel channels. Results are included for an unblocking transient (i.e., the debris suddenly exits the core, and the fuel flow reverts to the normal operating pattern), and it was demonstrated that during the unblocking large power peaks can be induced.},

	abstract = {Compressible fluid dynamics is of great practical interest in many industrial applications, ranging from chemistry to aeronautical industry, and to nuclear field as well. At the same time, modelling and simulation of compressible flows is a very complex task, requiring the development of specific approaches, in order to describe the effect of pressure on the fluid velocity field. Compressibility effects become even more important in the study of two-phase flows, due to the presence of a gaseous phase. In addition, compressibility is also expected to have a significant impact on other physics, such as chemical or nuclear reactions occurring in the mixture. In this perspective, multiphysics represents a useful approach to address this complex problem, providing a way to catch all the different physics that come into play as well as the coupling between them. In this work, a multiphysics model is developed for the analysis of the generation IV Molten Salt Fast Reactor (MSFR), with a specific focus on the compressibility effects of the fluid that acts as fuel in the reactor. The fuel mixture compressibility is expected to have an important effect on the system dynamics, especially in very rapid super-prompt-critical transients. In addition, the presence of a helium bubbling system used for online fission product removal could modify the fuel mixture compressibility, further affecting the system transient behaviour. Therefore, the MSFR represents an application of concrete interest, inherent to the analysis of compressibility effects and to the development of suitable modelling approaches. An OpenFOAM solver is developed to handle the fuel compressibility, the presence of gas bubbles in the reactor as well as the coupling between the system neutronics and fluid dynamics. The outcomes of this analysis point out that the fuel compressibility plays a crucial role in the evolution of fast transients, introducing delays in the expansion feedbacks that strongly affect the system dynamics. Moreover, it is found that the gas bubbles significantly alter the fuel compressibility, yielding even larger differences compared to the incompressible approximation usually adopted in the current MSFR solvers.},

The new module is successfully tested against a Monte Carlo model of the MSFR, in order to assess its correct implementation. Then, a neutronics analysis of the MSFR is carried out on a simplified axial-symmetric model of the reactor. Particular focus is devoted to the analysis of the MSFR helium bubbling system and its effect on reactivity. The presence of bubbles inside the reactor is handled with a two-fluid thermal-hydraulics module, previously implemented into the solver. The void reactivity coefficient is evaluated on the basis of the bubble spatial distribution calculated by the multiphysics solver. Then, the results are compared to simulations carried out with uniform bubble distributions, highlighting significant differences between the two approaches. The outcomes of this work constitute a step forward in the multiphysics analysis of the Molten Salt Fast Reactor and represent a useful starting point for the optimization of the MSFR helium bubbling system, as well as for the development of appropriate control strategies.},

The MSFR can adopt a closed thorium fuel cycle for sustainable operation through the breeding of 233 U from 232 Th. The fuel composition changes significantly over the course of its lifespan. In this study, we investigated the steady state and transient behavior of the MSFR using Moltres, a coupled neutronics/thermal-hydraulics code developed within the Multiphysics Object Oriented Simulation Environment (MOOSE) framework. Three different fuel compositions, start-up, early-life, and equilibrium, were examined for potentially dangerous core temperature excursions during a unprotected loss of heat sink (ULOHS) accident. The six-group and total neutron flux distributions showed good agreement with SERPENT and published MSFR results, while the temperature distribution and total power showed discrepancies which can be attributed toknown sources of error. For the transient behavior under the ULOHS scenario, while the transition time towards the new steady state core temperature is also in good agreement with existing MSFR simulations by Fiorina et al., Moltres under-estimated the temperature rise by a factor of ten, due to the same sources of error affecting the steady state results. While an MSFR loaded with start-up fuel composition operates at a higher temperature than with the other two fuel compositions, all three cases were shown to be inherently safe due to thestrong negative temperature feedback.},

Here, we propose the use of a coupled numerical benchmark specifically designed to assess the physics-coupling capabilities of the aforementioned codes. The benchmark focuses on the specific characteristics of fast MSRs and features a step-by-step approach, where physical phenomena are gradually coupled to easily identify sources of error. We collect and compare the results obtained during the benchmarking campaign of four multi-physics tools developed within the SAMOFAR project. Results show excellent agreement for all the steps of the benchmark.

	abstract = {In an operating nuclear reactor system, various physical phenomena of different properties are intimately linked. These multiphysics phenomena include neutronics (N), thermal-hydraulics (TH), materials science, and other subjects. Among them, the interaction between neutronics and thermal-hydraulics is of great significance in reactor design and safety analysis. In this work, different N/TH coupling methods are reviewed, including loose and tight coupling. For the studies on loose coupling, in which two physical fields are decoupled, the current research status is summarized and classified based on the coupling methods of neutronics and thermal-hydraulics. The studies of tight coupling are introduced based on multiphysics coupling platforms. The investigation shows that the number and objectives of loose coupling studies are more abundant and extensive than those of tight coupling. This indicates that loose coupling strategies are the mainstream coupling solutions in recent research. Furthermore, the solution approaches of N/TH coupling are reviewed with respect to the aspects of performance improvement and application studies, including the operator splitting (OS), Picard iteration, and Jacobian-Free Newton–Krylov (JFNK) methods. A comprehensive study of the solution approaches shows that most of the current loose coupling numerical simulations adopt the Picard iteration method, because it has higher calculation accuracy than the OS method. In contrast to the decoupling approaches such as the OS and Picard iteration methods, the JFNK method updates all physical quantities synchronously, which makes it more accurate. Hence, there are broad application prospects for N/TH tight coupling of the JFNK method.},
