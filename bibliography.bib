	abstract = {The CNRS has been involved in molten salt reactors since 1997. Starting from the Molten Salt Breeder Reactor project of Oak-Ridge, an innovative concept called Molten Salt Fast Reactor or MSFR has been proposed, resulting from extensive parametric studies in which various core arrangements, reprocessing performances and salt compositions were investigated to adapt the reactor in the framework of the deployment of a thorium based reactor fleet on a worldwide scale. The primary feature of the MSFR concept is the removal of the graphite moderator from the core (graphite-free core), resulting in a breeder reactor with a fast neutron spectrum and operated in the Thorium fuel cycle. MSFR has been recognized as a long term alternative to solid fuelled fast neutron systems with unique potential (negative safety coefficients, smaller fissile inventory, easy in-service inspection, simplified fuel cycle…) and has thus been selected for further studies by the Generation IV International Forum in 2008.In the MSFR, the liquid fuel processing is part of the reactor where a small side stream of the molten salt is processed for fission product removal and then returned to the reactor. This is fundamentally different from a solid fuel reactor where separate facilities produce the solid fuel and process the Spent Nuclear Fuel. Because of this design characteristic, the MSFR can thus operate with widely varying fuel composition. Thanks to this fuel composition flexibility, the MSFR concept may use as initial fissile load, {\textless}sup{\textgreater}233{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}U or enriched (between 5\% and 30\%) uranium or also the transuranic elements currently produced by PWRs in the world.Our reactor’s studies of the MSFR concept rely on numerical simulations making use of the MCNP neutron transport code coupled with a code for materials evolution which resolves the Bateman’s equations giving the population of each nucleus inside each part of the reactor at each moment. Because of MSR’s fundamental characteristics compared to classical solid-fuelled reactors, the classical Bateman equations have to be modified by adding two terms representing the reprocessing efficiencies and the fertile or fissile alimentation. We have finally coupled neutronic and reprocessing simulation codes in a numerical tool develop to calculate the evolution of the whole MSFR system. This tool is used to evaluate the extraction capacities of fission products and their location in the whole system (reactor and reprocessing unit), basis of any safety and radioprotection assessment of the reactor., Le CNRS s’intéresse aux réacteurs à sels fondus (RSF) depuis 1997. Dans le but de proposer un réacteur critique basé sur le cycle thorium pour la production d’énergie, des études plus complètes sont menées à partir de 1999. Une réévaluation complète du MSBR qui constituait alors la configuration de référence des RSF est tout d’abord effectuée, suivie d’une étude systématique d’optimisation du comportement de ce type de réacteurs en s’éloignant du design initial. Ces travaux ont permis de faire émerger un concept de réacteur innovant, qui a été sélectionné fin 2008 par le Forum International Generation IV comme représentant type des réacteurs à sels fondus et qui a désormais comme dénomination officielle : MSFR (Molten Salt Fast Reactor). Il s’agit d’un concept de réacteur surrégénérateur à spectre neutronique rapide et en cycle Thorium, qui présente une très bonne stabilité intrinsèque de fonctionnement grâce à des coefficients de sûreté tous négatifs, et un processus de retraitement du combustible in-situ simplifié acceptable d’un point de vue économique. Ce réacteur se place dans le contexte d’une filière d’utilisation du Thorium qui est un élément fertile abondant dans la nature, en association avec des éléments fissiles naturels ({\textless}sup{\textgreater}235{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}U) ou non ({\textless}sup{\textgreater}233{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}U) ou encore qui proviennent de la chaine de gestion des éléments radioactifs à vie longue des réacteurs actuels (Np, Pu, Am, …).Les études menées sont basées sur le couplage du code de transport de neutrons MCNP avec le code d’évolution des matériaux REM développé au CNRS. La résolution des équations de Bateman qui est effectuée permet de connaître la population de chaque noyau dans chaque partie du réacteur à chaque instant. Du fait des caractéristiques fondamentales des RSF qui sont très différentes de celles des réacteurs à combustible solide, ces équations doivent être modifiées pour prendre en compte la capacité d’alimentation en matière fissile et fertile, ainsi que le retraitement du sel combustible, de manière continue sans arrêt du réacteur. Nous avons finalement associé le code décrivant l’évolution du coeur et une représentation simulée du retraitement pour construire un outil numérique servant au calcul de l’évolution du système complet. Cet outil permet d’évaluer l’efficacité du retraitement vis-à-vis de l’ensemble des produits de fission (en supposant une efficacité donnée pour le procédé physicochimique utilisé), ainsi que de déterminer leur localisation dans le système. Ces informations sont essentielles pour pouvoir aborder une étude de la sûreté ou de la radioprotection du système.},

	abstract = {Molten-salt breeder reactors (MSBR’s) are being developed by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory for generating low-cost power while extending the nation’s resources of fissionable fuel. The fluid fuel in these reactors, consisting of UF4 and ThF4 dissolved in fluorides of beryllium and lithium, is circulated through a reactor core moderated by graphite. Technology developments over the past 20 years have culminated in the successful operation of the 8-MW(th) MoltenSalt Reactor Experiment (MSRE), and have indicated that operation with a molten fuel is practical, that the salt is stable under reactor conditions, and that corrosion is very low. Processing of the MSRE fuel has demonstrated the MSR processing associated with high-performance converters. New fuel processing methods under development should permit MSR’s to operate as economical breeders. These features, combined with high thermal efficiency (44\%) and low primary system pressure, give MSR converters and breeders potentially favorable economic, fuel utilization, and safety characteristics. Further, these reactors can be initially fueled with 233U, 235U, or plutonium. The construction cost of an MSBR power plant is estimated to be about the same as that of light-water reactors. This could lend to power costs 0.5 to 1.0 mill/kWh less than those for light-water reactors. Achievement of economic molten-salt breeder reactors requires the construction and operation of several reactors of increasing size and their associated processing plants.},

	abstract = {The SAS4A/SASSYS-1 computer code is developed by Argonne National Laboratory for thermal, hydraulic, and neutronic analysis of power and flow transients in liquidmetal- cooled nuclear reactors (LMRs). SAS4A was developed to analyze severe core disruption accidents with coolant boiling and fuel melting and relocation, initiated by a very low probability coincidence of an accident precursor and failure of one or more safety systems. SASSYS-1, originally developed to address loss-of-decay-heat-removal accidents, has evolved into a tool for margin assessment in design basis accident (DBA) analysis and for consequence assessment in beyond-design-basis accident (BDBA) analysis. SAS4A contains detailed, mechanistic models of transient thermal, hydraulic, neutronic, and mechanical phenomena to describe the response of the reactor core, its coolant, fuel elements, and structural members to accident conditions. The core channel models in SAS4A provide the capability to analyze the initial phase of core disruptive accidents, through coolant heat-up and boiling, fuel element failure, and fuel melting and relocation. Originally developed to analyze oxide fuel clad with stainless steel, the models in SAS4A have been extended and specialized to metallic fuel with advanced alloy cladding. SASSYS-1 provides the capability to perform a detailed thermal/hydraulic simulation of the primary and secondary sodium coolant circuits and the balance-ofplant steam/water circuit. These sodium and steam circuit models include component models for heat exchangers, pumps, valves, turbines, and condensers, and thermal/hydraulic models of pipes and plena. SASSYS-1 also contains a plant protection and control system modeling capability, which provides digital representations of reactor, pump, and valve controllers and their response to input signal changes.},

	abstract = {Molten salt reactor (MSR) as 1 candidate of the generation IV advanced nuclear power systems attracted more attention in China due to its top ranked in fuel cycle and thorium utilization. Two types of MSR concepts were studied and developed in parallel, namely the MSR with liquid fuel and that with solid fuel. Abundant fundamental research including the neutronics modeling, thermal-hydraulics modeling, safety analysis, material investigation, molten salts technologies etc. were carried out. Some analysis software such as COUPLE and FANCY were developed. Several experimental facilities like high-temperature fluoride salt experiment loop have been constructed. Some passive residual heat removal systems were designed, and 1 test facility is under construction. The key MSR techniques including the extraction and separation of molten salt and construction of N-base alloy have been mastered. Based on these fundamental research, Chinese Academy of Sciences has completed the design of thorium-based MSRs with solid fuel and liquid fuel and is promoting their construction in the near future. In China, future efforts should be paid to the material, online fuel processing, Th-U fuel cycle, component design, and construction and thermal-hydraulic experiments for MSR, which are rather challenging nowadays.},

Once the design life of the IMSR is reached, for example, in the range of 3 to 10 years, it is disconnected, removed and replaced as a unit. The spent IMSR functions as the medium or long term storage of the radioactive graphite and/or heat exchangers and/or control rods and/or fuel salt contained in the vessel of the IMSR. The present also relates to a nuclear reactor that has a buffer salt surrounding the nuclear vessel. During normal operation of the nuclear reactor, the nuclear reactor operates at a temperature that is lower than the melting point of the buffer salt and the buffer salt acts as a thermal insulator. Upon loss of external cooling, the temperature of the nuclear reactor increases and melts the buffer salt, which can then transfer heat from the nuclear core to a cooled containment vessel.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a multi-physics modelling (MPM) approach developed for the study of the dynamics of the Molten Salt Reactor (MSR), which has been reconsidered as one of the future nuclear power plants in the framework of the Generation IV International Forum for its several potentialities. The proposed multi-physics modelling is aimed at the description of the coupling between heat transfer, fluid dynamics and neutronics characteristics in a typical MSR core channel, taking into account the spatial effects of the most relevant physical quantities. In particular, as far as molten salt thermo-hydrodynamics is concerned, Navier–Stokes equations are used with the turbulence treatment according to the RANS (Reynolds Averaged Navier–Stokes) scheme, while the heat transfer is taken into account through the energy balance equations for the fuel salt and the graphite. As far as neutronics is concerned, the two-group diffusion theory is adopted, where the group constants (computed by means of the neutron transport code NEWT of SCALE 5.1) are included into the model in order to describe the neutron flux and the delayed neutron precursor distributions, the system time constants, and the temperature feedback effects of both graphite and fuel salt. The developed MPM approach is implemented in the unified simulation environment offered by COMSOL Multiphysics®, and is applied to study the behaviour of the system in steady-state conditions and under several transients (i.e., reactivity insertion due to control rod movements, fuel mass flow rate variations due to the change of the pump working conditions, presence of periodic perturbations), pointing out some advantages offered with respect to the conventional approaches employed in literature for the MSRs.},

In a thermal spectrum, it would be possible to reach an acceptable concept only after in depth investigations taking into account the effect of the salt (negative feedback coefficient) and of the graphite (which makes the global feedback coefficient positive) separately. For very thermalized spectra, the global coefficients are negative thanks to the large neutron losses in the moderator but this leads also to a very poor breeding ratio. Epithermal or fast neutron spectra thus seem more favorable since they combine good feedback coefficients with satisfactory breeding ratio. However they lead to severe problems with the graphite’s ability to withstand the irradiation. As a result, the solution that removes the moderating block seems especially attractive."},

	abstract = {The concept of the molten salt reactor (MSR) refuses to go away. The Generation-IV process lists the MSR as one of the six concepts to be considered for extending fuel resources. Good fuel utilization and good economics are required to meet the often-cited goal of 10 TWe globally and 1 TWe for the US by non-carbon energy sources in this century by nuclear fission. Strong incentives for the molten salt reactor design are its good fuel utilization, good economics, amazing fuel flexibility and promised large benefits. It can:• use thorium or uranium; • be designed with lots of graphite to have a fairly thermal neutron spectrum or without graphite moderator to have an epithermal neutron spectrum; • fission uranium isotopes and plutonium isotopes; • produces less long-lived wastes than today’s reactors by a factor of 10–100; • operate with non-weapon grade fissile fuel, or in suitable sites it can operate with enrichment between reactor-grade and weapon grade fissile fuel; • be a breeder or near breeder; • operate at temperature \&gt;1100 °C if carbon composites are successfully developed. Enhancing 232U content in the uranium to over 500 ppm makes the fuel undesirable for weapons, but it should not detract from its economic use in liquid fuel reactors: a big advantage in nonproliferation. Economics of the MSR are enhanced by operating at low pressure and high temperature and may even lead to the preferred route to hydrogen production. The cost of the electricity produced from low enriched fuel averaged over the life of the entire process, has been predicted to be about 10\% lower than that from LWRs, and 20\% lower for high-enriched fuel, with uncertainties of about 10\%. The development cost has been estimated at about 1 B\$ (e.g., a 100 M\$/year base program for 10 years) not including construction of a series of reactors leading up to the deployment of multiple commercial units at an assumed cost of 9 B\$ (450 M\$/year over 20 years). A benefit of liquid fuel is that smaller power reactors can faithfully test features of larger reactors, thereby reducing the number of steps to commercial deployment. Assuming electricity is worth \$ 50 per MWe h, then 50 years of 10 TWe power level would be worth 200 trillion dollars. If the MSR could be developed and proven for 10 B\$ and would save 10\% over its alternative, the total savings over 50 years would be 20 trillion dollars: a good return on investment even considering discounted future savings. The incentives for the molten salt reactor are so strong and its relevance to our energy policy and national security are so compelling that one asks, “Why has the reactor not already been developed?”},

For liquid-fueled MSRs, the salt can be processed online or in a batch mode to allow for removal of fission products as well as for introduction of fissile fuel and fertile materials during reactor operation. The MSR is most commonly associated with the 233U/thorium fuel cycle, as the nuclear properties of 233U combined with the online removal of parasitic absorbers enable the design of a thermal-spectrum breeder reactor. However, MSR concepts have been developed using all neutron energy spectra (thermal, intermediate, fast, and mixed-spectrum zoned concepts) and with a variety of fuels including uranium, thorium, plutonium, and minor actinides. Early MSR work was supported by a significant research and development (R\&D) program that resulted in two experimental systems operating at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the 1950s and 1960s: the Aircraft Reactor Experiment and the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment. Subsequent design studies in the 1970s focusing on thermal-spectrum thorium-fueled systems established reference concepts for two major design variants: (1) a molten salt breeder reactor (MSBR) with multiple configurations that could breed additional fissile material or maintain self-sustaining operation and (2) a denatured molten salt reactor (DMSR) with enhanced proliferation resistance. MSRs have been selected as one of the Generation IV systems, and development activity has been seen in fast-spectrum MSRs, waste-burning MSRs, and MSRs fueled with low-enriched uranium as well as in more traditional thorium fuel cycle–based MSRs. This paper provides a historical background of MSR R\&D efforts, surveys and summarizes many of the recent developments, and provides analysis comparing thorium-based MSRs by way of example.},

The initial goal was an aircraft propulsion reactor, and a molten fluoride-fueled Aircraft Reactor Experiment was operated at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in 1954. In 1956, the objective shifted to civilian nuclear power, and reactor concepts were developed using a circulating UF4-ThF4 fuel, graphite moderator, and Hastelloy N pressure boundary. The program culminated in the successful operation of the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment in 1965 to 1969. By then the Atomic Energy Commission’s goals had shifted to breeder development; the molten salt program supported on-site reprocessing development and study of various reactor arrangements that had potential to breed. Some commercial and foreign interest contributed to the program which, however, was terminated by the government in 1976. The current status of the technology and prospects for revived interest are summarized.},

The hot spot temperature is less than 10 °C above the average core outlet temperature and is located in the centre of the top wall of the core.

The major component of this work has been the provision of a suitable form of the model for regions where the turbulence Reynolds number is low. The model has been applied to the prediction of wall boundary-layer flows in which streamwise accelerations are so severe that the boundary layer reverts partially towards laminar. In all cases, the predicted hydrodynamic and heat-transfer development of the boundary layers is in close agreement with the measured behaviour. L'article présente un nouveau modèle de turbulence dans lequel la viscosité turbulente locale est déterminée à partir de la solution des équations de transport pour l'énergie cinétique de turbulence et la vitesse de dissipation d'énergie. La majeure partie de ce travail a été l'élaboration d'une forme adéquate du modèle pour des régions où le nombre de Reynolds de turbulence est faible. Le modèle a été appliqué à la prédiction des écoulements à couche limite à la paroi dans lesquels des accélérations longitudinales sont si fortes que la couche limite redevient partiellement laminaire. Dans tous les cas, le développement hydrodynamique et thermique prévu des couches limites est en parfait accord avec le comportement observé. Die Arbeit behandelt ein neuse Turbulenzmodell, bei dem die örtliche turbulente Zähigkeit aus der Lösung der Transportgleichungen für die kinetische Energie der Turbulenz und der Energiedissipation bestimmt wird. Der Hauptteil dieser Arbeit bestand darin, eine passende Form des Modells für Bereiche zu schaffen, in denen die Reynoldszahl der Turbulenz niedrig ist. Das Modell ist auf die Bestimmung von Wandgrenzschichtströmungen angewandt worden, bein denen so starke Beschleunigungen in Strömungsrichtung auftreten, dass die Grenzschicht teilweise in den laminaren Bereicht umschlägt. In allen Fällen ist die berechnete Entwicklung der hydrodynamischen und thermischen Grenzschicht in guter Übereinstimmung mit dem gemessenen Verhalten.},

	abstract = {In this work, the Monte Carlo burn-up code SERPENT-2 has been extended and employed to study the material isotopic evolution of the Molten Salt Fast Reactor (MSFR).

This promising GEN-IV nuclear reactor concept features peculiar characteristics such as the on-line fuel reprocessing, which prevents the use of commonly available burn-up codes. Besides, the presence of circulating nuclear fuel and radioactive streams from the core to the reprocessing plant requires a precise knowledge of the fuel isotopic composition during the plant operation.

The developed extension of SERPENT-2 directly takes into account the effects of on-line fuel reprocessing on burn-up calculations and features a reactivity control algorithm. It is here assessed against a dedicated version of the deterministic ERANOS-based EQL3D procedure (PSI-Switzerland) and adopted to analyze the MSFR fuel salt isotopic evolution.

Particular attention is devoted to study the effects of reprocessing time constants and efficiencies on the conversion ratio and the molar concentration of elements relevant for solubility issues (e.g., trivalent actinides and lanthanides). Quantities of interest for fuel handling and safety issues are investigated, including decay heat and activities of hazardous isotopes (neutron and high energy gamma emitters) in the core and in the reprocessing stream. The radiotoxicity generation is also analyzed for the MSFR nominal conditions.

The production of helium and the depletion in tungsten content due to nuclear reactions are calculated for the nickel-based alloy selected as reactor structural material of the MSFR. These preliminary evaluations can be helpful in studying the radiation damage of both the primary salt container and the axial reflectors.},

These applications pose new challenges for the tracking routines and result estimators, originally developed for a very specific task. The purpose of this paper is to explain how the basic collision estimator based cell flux tally in Serpent 2 is implemented, and how it is applied for calculating integral reaction rates. The methodology and its limitations are demonstrated by an example, in which the tally is applied for calculating collision rates in a problem with very low physical collision density. It is concluded that Serpent has a lot of potential to expand its scope of applications beyond reactor physics, but in order to be applied for such problems it is important that the code users understand the underlying methods and their limitations.},

Coupled to this neutronic approach, the Computational Fluid Dynamics code OpenFOAM is used to model the complex flow pattern in the core. An accurate interpolation model developed to take into account the thermal hydraulics feedback on the neutronics including reactivity and neutron flux variation is presented.

	abstract = {The moderated Molten Salt Reactor (MSR) is an attractive breeder reactor. However, the temperature feedback coefficient of such a system can be positive due to the contribution of the moderator, an effect that can only be avoided with special measures. A previous study (Nagy et al., 2010) aimed to find a core design that is a breeder and has negative overall temperature feedback coefficient. In this paper, a coupled calculation scheme, which includes the reactor physics, heat transfer and fluid dynamics calculations is introduced. It is used both for steady-state and for dynamic calculations to evaluate the safety of the core design which was selected from the results of the previous study. The calculated feedback coefficients on the salt and graphite temperatures, power and uranium concentration prove that the core design derived in the previous optimization study is safe because the temperature feedback coefficient of the core and of the power is sufficiently negative. Transient calculations are performed to show the inherent safety of the reactor in case of reactivity insertion. As it is shown, the response of the reactor to these transients is initially dominated by the strong negative feedback of the salt. In all the presented transients, the reactor power stabilizes and the temperature of the salt never approaches its boiling point.},

Historically, simulation of an entire reactor was accomplished by linking together multiple existing codes that each simulated a subset of the relevant multiphysics phenomena. Recent advances in the MOOSE (Multiphysics Object Oriented Simulation Environment) framework have enabled a new approach: multiple domain-specific applications, all built on the same software framework, are efficiently linked to create a cohesive application. This is accomplished with a flexible coupling capability that allows for a variety of different data exchanges to occur simultaneously on high performance parallel computational hardware. Examples based on the KAIST-3A benchmark core, as well as a simplified Westinghouse AP-1000 configuration, demonstrate the power of this new framework for tackling—in a coupled, multiscale manner—crucial reactor phenomena such as CRUD-induced power shift and fuel shuffle.},

	abstract = {Molten Salt Reactors (MSRs) were conceived at the early stages of nuclear energy in view of the favourable features fostered by a liquid fuel. They were developed as graphite-moderated thorium-fuelled breeder reactors till the seventies, when studies on this reactor concept were mostly abandoned in favour of the liquid–metal fast breeder concepts. A decade ago, the MSRs were included among the six GEN-IV systems and a core optimization process allowing for the GEN-IV main objectives led toward a fast-spectrum MSR concept (MSFR – Molten Salt Fast Reactor). Albeit advantageous in terms of U-233 breeding and/or radio-active waste burning, the new concept lacks the notable know-how available for the thermal-spectrum MSR technology. The present paper preliminarily investigates the MSR dynamics, based on the conceptual MSFR design currently available. A primary objective is to benchmark two different models of the MSFR primary circuit, both of them including a detailed and fully-coupled (node-wise) representation of turbulent fuel-salt flow, neutron diffusion, and delayed-neutron precursor diffusion and convection. A good agreement is generally observed between the adopted models, though some discrepancies exist in the temperature-field, with ensuing mild impacts on the reactor dynamics. The performed analyses are also used for a preliminary characterization of the MSFR steady-state and accidental transient response. Some points of enhancement needed in the MSFR conceptual design are identified, mainly related to in-core velocity and temperature fields. The reactor response following major accidental transient initiators suggests a generally benign behaviour of this reactor concept.},

The main goals of this article are: (1) to provide a basic reference source that describes libMesh and the underlying philosophy and software design approach; (2) to give sufficient detail and references on the adaptive mesh refinement and coarsening (AMR/C) scheme for applications analysts and developers; and (3) to describe the parallel implementation and data structures with supporting discussion of domain decomposition, message passing, and details related to dynamic repartitioning for parallel AMR/C. Other aspects related to C++ programming paradigms, reusability for diverse applications, adaptive modeling, physics-independent error indicators, and similar concepts are briefly discussed. Finally, results from some applications using the library are presented and areas of future research are discussed.},

	abstract = {In the framework of the Generation IV International Forum (GIF-IV), six innovative concepts of nuclear reactors have been proposed as suitable to guarantee a safe, sustainable and proliferation resistant source of nuclear energy. Among these reactors, a peculiar role is played by the Molten Salt Reactor (MSR), which is the only one with a liquid and circulating fuel. This feature leads to a complex and highly coupled behaviour, which requires careful investigations, as a consequence of some unusual features like the drift of Delayed Neutron Precursors (DNP) along the primary circuit and heat transfer with a heat-generating fluid. The inherently coupled dynamics of the MSRs asks for innovative approaches to perform reliable transient analyses. The node-wise implicitly-coupled solution of the Partial Differential Equations (PDE) that govern the different phenomena in a reactor would offer in this sense an ideal solution. However, such an approach (hereinafter referred to as Multi-Physics – MP) requires a huge amount of computational power. In this work, we propose and assess a Geometric Multiscale approach on MSR, addressing the core modelling with a 3-D MP approach and the remaining part of the system – e.g., the cooling loop – with simplified 0-D models based on Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE). The aim is to conjugate the accuracy of the MP modelling approach with acceptable computation loads. Reference is made to the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE), due to the availability of a detailed design and experimental data that are used for assessment and preliminary validation of the developed simulation tool.},

Particular attention is devoted to the description of the adopted time integration and physics coupling strategies. The proposed model features the adoption of an implicit Runge–Kutta scheme and the coupling among neutron diffusion, Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes equations for mass and momentum conservation, and energy and delayed neutron precursor balance equations, in order to accurately catch thermal feedbacks on neutronics. The solver is aimed at performing fast-running simulations of the full-core three-dimensional Molten Salt Fast Reactor geometry. The neutronics modelling is assessed against Monte Carlo simulations and the results of a simplified case study are compared to those from multiphysics tools previously developed. As an example of the capability of the model, an unprotected MSFR single pump failure accidental scenario is simulated and discussed. The main purpose of the present model is to serve as fast-running computational tool in the phase of design optimization of fuel loop components. More in general, it is of valuable help in the study of reactor physics of circulating-fuel systems.},

Does the reactor go solid as soon as the reaction stops, or does the decay heat keep it liquid for a while. If so, how long before it becomes liquid? That should be a simple analysis, but I don't know anything about thermal hydraulics…- An advantage of solid fuel is that the fission products are contained. A disadvantage, compared to liquid fuel, is that the burnup is limited by material properties of the fuel materials. (What is the burnup limit for the pebble in the FHR?)-  ‘denatured’  MEANS {\textless}20\% enrichment""" Advantageous characteristics of the basic molten-salt reactor include:1) a reactor in which a ‘liquid core’ can burn a variety of fuels: 233 UF4 , 235 UF4  or 239 PuF4. Fuel salt in the form of uranium fluoride or plutonium fluoride is dissolved in the molten salt coolant and undergoes fission in the reactor core.2) Since the fuel is already molten in the primary coolant, there is no possibility of fuel meltdown. The primary coolant, its fuel and fission products can be easily immobilised in the event of a reactor ‘scram’ due to the salt’s high freezing ({\textasciitilde}458°C) temperature and low vapour pressure (evaporation rate). In the event of an emergency shutdown, the coolant can be drained into separate sub-critical holding tanks.3) The fluoride salt is known as FLiBe; standing for Fluoride-Lithium-Beryllium. FLiBe has a melting temperature of {\textasciitilde}458°C and a boiling temperature of {\textasciitilde}1400°C. The primary coolant fuel salt has a molar composition of 70\% 7 LiF, 18\% BeF2  and a 12\% mixture of 235 UF4 , ThF4  and ZrF4 . The secondary coolant salt responsible for driving the turbine generators is composed of lithium fluoride and beryllium fluoride only and has a 2:1 lithium to beryllium ratio (Li2 BeF4 ).4) FLiBe has a similar volumetric heat capacity and a similar thermal conductivity compared to pressurized water. The higher boiling point and lower vapour pressure of FLiBe means MSRs operate at higher thermal efficiencies, and the ability to operate without pressurisation compared to current water-cooled PWRs.5) Unlike Na-K coolants of Fast Breeder Reactors, FLiBe will not violently react with water or burn in air.6) Since MSRs do not require a pressurised primary-containment or a large secondary containment building for steam capture as needed for PWRs, MSR reactor size and back-up safety systems can be reduced in volume and complexity.7) Costly PWR fuel-bundle fabrication is unnecessary for liquid fueled MSRs, reducing operational costs.8) With a molten core with liquid fuel, krypton and xenon poisons can be out-gassed and removed from the primary coolant during operation, avoiding the ceramic cracking and damage associated with UO2  pellet irradiation.9) A liquid fuel MSR works well when deployed in tandem with a reprocessing facility to maintain minimum fissile inventory in the core. Fuel reprocessing including refueling and waste removal can occur whilst the MSR remains at power (ie. on-the-fly reprocessing). Also, sufficiently low fission inventory in the salt can be maintained so that decay heat could be minimised after reactor shutdown.10) Since the primary cooling loop operates at a high temperature (700°C - 1000°C), it is possible to use Brayton cycle turbines that are compact and have the potential to deliver 45\% thermal-mechanical conversion efficiency.Challenges to be addressed for liquid-fuel molten salts reactors with FLiBe:1) the primary coolant loop will be highly radioactive due to fission products being in solution with the primary coolant salt. This will complicate maintenance procedures which would require the use of flushing salts and remote handling techniques.2) Beryllium is chemically toxic.3) lithium-7 must be +99.99\% pure and its isotopic separation from Lithium-6 is costly. Lithium 6 is unwanted for its transmutation into tritium upon neutron capture. The presence of tritium (an isotope of hydrogen) can degrade the structural integrity of the containment vessel.4) Close attention must be paid to the chemical composition of the salt to maintain a chemically reduced solution for deterring uranium out-precipitation. The out precipitation of uranium would lead to solid uranium depositing on the bottom of the reactor vessel, causing local hot spots that may affect the integrity of the primary containment vessel. One manner of control is to vary the mixture of UF4  to UF3  during operations to maintain a slight excess of fluorine molecules.5) As the fuel is burnt in the core, fission products will be produced. Each fission product and daughter decay products would react differently with the metal alloy containment vessel. More work needs to be done to understand the reaction between alloys and fission products.6) The benefit of having a primary coolant with a high melting point that will ‘freeze easily’ to immobilize waste could result in some operational challenges. Some areas of the reactor that loose heat easily – eg heat exchanger surfaces and long narrow tubing, must be sufficiently well designed so they don’t freeze over during reactor operation.7) FLiBe salts have the ability to maintain a liquid form up to 1400°C, allowing the possibility for very high temperature operations. The metallic alloys containing the liquid thus become the system’s weakest link. To exploit FLiBe’s advantages, new metallic alloys or non-metallics (eg. C-Si) resistant to both high temperatures and radiation need to be developed and qualified.Proponents of the MSR design often talk of using U-233, bred from thorium, as fuel. Characteristics of the thorium fuel cycle include:1) U-233 breeding by Th-232 neutron capture. Fast or thermal neutron capture by Th-232 produces Th-233 (halflife 22min) beta decaying to Pa-233 (half-life 27days) and beta decaying again to U-233 (half-life 1.59 x 105 years) following the Neptunium decay series.2) U-233 can be chemically separated from Pa-233 and Th-232 in contrast to costly U-235/U 238 isotopic separation.3) From a nuclear non-proliferation stand point using thorium / U-233 is preferable. The breeding of U-233 contains trace amounts of a hard-gamma emitter: Tl-208. This makes U-233 difficult to handle and easier to detect.4) The hard-gamma emitting decay products U-233 means they are difficult to handle and fabricate into dioxide pellet fuel. The use of U-233 is more straight-forward in MSRs which only require their dissolution in the primary coolant.5) The thorium fuel cycle produces less long-life radioactive waste compared to the U-235/U238 fuel cycle.6) Thorium reserves are plentiful; its relative abundance is 4 times that of natural uranium and has the potential to supply earth’s energy demands for thousands of years.},

	abstract = {The United States demonstrated the feasibility of Molten Salt Reactors (MSRs) with the Aircraft Reactor Experiment (1954) and the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment (1965–69). Liquid fuel MSRs can avoid many of the problems of light water reactors (LWRs): fuel manufacture, fuel lifetime, refueling shutdowns, core melt (TMI accident), steam explosion (Chernobyl accident), hydrogen explosion (Fukushima Daiichi accident), and long-lived radioactive (actinide) waste disposal. Thorium fuel can be converted into U-233 fuel, instead of using U-235 from enrichment of natural uranium. One ton of ThO2 can generate as much energy as 293 tons of U3O8 and thorium is four times as abundant in the earth’s crust as uranium. Solid fuel MSRs could be similar to LWRs with molten salt coolant instead of water, so they could be developed quickly, but would lack the advantages of liquid fuel, which include no manufacture of fuel pellets, no fuel melt hazard, fuel burnup not limited by radiation damage, continuous refueling, actinide recycling, and fission product removal. The fuel processing plant must be developed to separate uranium, thorium, actinides, and fission products in a highly radioactive environment. Actinides generated by LWRs could be burned in MSRs, instead of being treated as radioactive wastes requiring geological disposal. Research on MSRs and thorium energy is underway in 23 countries, and reactor designs from several companies are described in this book.},

	abstract = {Molten salt reactors (MSRs) have a long history with the first design studies beginning in the 1950s at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). Traditionally these reactors are thought of as thermal breeder reactors running on the thorium to 233U cycle and the historical competitor to fast breeder reactors. In the recent years, there has been a growing interest in molten salt reactors, which have been considered in the framework of the Generation IV International Forum, because of their several potentialities and favorable features when compared with conventional solid-fueled reactors. MSRs meet many of the future goals of nuclear energy, in particular for what concerns an improved sustainability, an inherent safety with strong negative temperature coefficient of reactivity, stable coolant, low pressure operation that don not require expensive containment, easy to control, passive decay heat cooling and unique characteristics in terms of actinide burning and waste reduction, while benefiting from the past experience acquired with the molten salt technology. As the only liquid-fueled reactor concept, the safety basis, characteristics and licensing of an MSR are different from solid-uranium fueled light water reactors. In this paper, a historical review of the major plant systems in MSR is presented. The features of different safety characteristics of MSR power plant are reviewed and assessment in comparison to other solid fueled light water reactors LWRs.},

The fuel is 233U carried in a LiF-BeF2-ThF4 mixture which is molten above 930°F. Thorium is converted to 233U in excess of fissile burnup so that bred material is a plant product. The estimated fuel yield is 3.3\% per year.The estimated construction cost of the station is comparable to PWR total construction costs. The power production cost, including fuel-cycle and graphite replacement costs, with private utility financing, is estimated to be 0.5 to 1 mill/kWh less than that for present-day light-water reactors, largely due to the low fuel-cycle cost and high plant thermal efficiency.After engineering development of the fuel purification processes and large-scale components, a practical plant similar to the one described here appears to be feasible.},

	abstract = {The most important target of the concept “sustainability” is to achieve fairness between generations. Its expanding interpolation leads to achieve fairness within a generation. Thus, it is necessary to discuss the role of nuclear power from the viewpoint of this definition. The history of nuclear power has been the control of the nuclear fission reaction. Once this is obtained, then the economy of the system is required. On the other hand, it is also necessary to consider the internalization of the external diseconomy to avoid damage to human society caused by the economic activity itself, due to its limited capacity. An extreme example is waste. Thus, reducing radioactive waste resulting from nuclear power is essential. Nuclear non-proliferation must be guaranteed. Moreover, the FUKUSHIMA accident revealed that it is still not enough that human beings control nuclear reaction. Further, the most essential issue for sustaining use of one technology is human resources in manufacturing, operation, policy-making and education. Nuclear power will be able to satisfy the requirements of sustainability only when these subjects are addressed. The author will review recent activities of a thorium molten-salt reactor (MSR) as a cornerstone for a sustainable society and describe its objectives and forecasts.},

Many countries worldwide contribute to this reactor technology, among which the European Union, France, Japan, Russia and the USA, and for the past few years China and India have also contributed. In general, the international R\&D focuses on three main lines of research. The USA focuses on the FHR, which will be a nearer-term application of liquid salt as a reactor coolant, while China also focuses on solid fuel reactors as a precursor to molten salt reactors with liquid fuel and a thermal neutron spectrum. The EU, France and Russia are focusing on the development of a fast spectrum molten salt reactor capable of either breeding or transmutation of actinides from spent nuclear fuel. Future research topics focus on liquid salt technology and materials behavior, the fuel and fuel cycle chemistry and modeling, and the numerical simulation and safety design aspects of the reactor. MSR development attracts more and more attention every year, because it is generally considered as most sustainable of the six Generation-IV designs with intrinsic safety features. Continuing joint efforts are needed to advance common molten salt reactor technologies.},

	title = {The molten salt fast reactor as a fast spectrum candidate for thorium implementation},
	url = {https://www.politesi.polimi.it/handle/10589/74324},
	abstract = {The thesis work investigates the Molten Salt Fast Reactor (MSFR) technology as a possible route to combine the potential advantages of thorium use in Fast Reactors (FR) with the fuel cycle advantages fostered by a liquid fuel. The MSFR emerges as a promising reactor for its capability to operate as a flexible conversion ratio reactor. It shows good performances as U-233 breeder, though uncertainties exist on the U-233 capture cross-section in the neutron energy range of interest for the MSFR. Operation as a self-sustaining reactor fosters low consumption of natural resources, very limited waste generation, and simplified fuel management thanks to the liquid fuel. The MSFR also shows promising features in terms of radioactive waste transmutation thanks to the liquid fuel, the high specific power and the relatively hard spectrum. Safety aspects are investigated through analysis of the reactor safety parameters, and via prediction of the new reactor steady-state after accidental transient initiators. The MSFR inherent safety appears comparable to that of traditional FRs, especially considering its capability to withstand all major double-fault accidents. In addition, the MSFR presents only negative reactivity feedback coefficients, which is a unique feature among fast-spectrum reactors. The system thermal-hydraulics is also investigated in view of the internal heat generation in the working fluid. A correlation is proposed and application to the MSFR allows to exclude major impacts of decay heat on the MSFR out-of-core components, with a note of caution on the design of channels with low velocities and/or large diameters. In addition, a multi-physics model is developed to investigate the thermal-hydraulic behavior of the core, showing some points of enhancement needed in the current MSFR conceptual design. The same model is employed for investigating the reactor transient response to major accidental events, confirming the MSFR promising safety features pointed out with simpler approaches, but suggesting also possible problems related to the quick fuel temperature rise in case of a loss of heat sink.},

Based on the MSRE and MSBR concepts developed by ORNL in the 60s which involve a liquid fuel constituted of fluorine molten salt at a temperature close to 600°C, new developments with innovative approach and technology have been realized which contribute to strongly improve the concept. The thorium breeder potentiality is closely related to the use of a liquid fuel which is able to be periodically treated. A reprocessing scheme has been established to treat used fuel by extraction of fission products. According to the Gen IV philosophy for closed cycle nuclear reactor, the actinides are sent back in the reactor core. In this way, the wastes radiotoxicity is strongly decreased and the use of natural resource is optimized. This paper describes an innovative reactor concept, the TMSR-NM (non-moderated thorium molten salt reactor), from the nuclear physic point of view and the different steps involving in the reprocessing scheme from the chemical point of view.},

	abstract = {The development of spatial dynamics code for molten salt reactors (MSRs) is reported in this paper. The graphite-moderated channel type MSR – one of the ‘Generation IV’ concepts – was selected for the numerical simulation. It has several peculiarities (e.g. the drift of delayed neutrons precursors), which disable the use of standard dynamics codes. Therefore, the own DYN3D-MSR code was developed. It is based on the light water reactor code DYN3D and it allows transients simulation by 3D neutronics and parallel channel thermal-hydraulics. The neutronics and thermal-hydraulics were modified for the MSR peculiarities, where the experience from DYN1D-MSR development was exploited. The code was validated on experimental results from the MSRE experiment done in Oak Ridge National Laboratory and by the comparison with other codes especially with the 1D version. However, by the 3D code transients can be simulated, where space-dependant efforts are relevant, like local blockage of fuel channels or local temperature perturbations.},

The reactor physics part is based on diffusion theory, extended by a term representing the flow of the fuel through the core. The calculation of the temperature field is done by modeling all fuel channels, which are coupled to each other by a three-dimensional heat conduction equation. For the purpose of validation, the results of the MSR Experiment (MSRE) natural-circulation experiment and the thermal feedback coefficients of the reactor have been calculated and compared.
With the aid of a code system developed to implement this scheme, calculations were carried out for the normal operating state of the MSRE and some debris-induced channel-blocking-incident transients. In the case of the MSRE, it is shown that the severity of such an incident strongly depends on the degree of channel blocking and that high-temperature gradients in the moderator can connect thermally the adjacent fuel channels. Results are included for an unblocking transient (i.e., the debris suddenly exits the core, and the fuel flow reverts to the normal operating pattern), and it was demonstrated that during the unblocking large power peaks can be induced.},

These advances focus on neutron cross sections, covariances, fission product yields and decay data, and represent work by the US Cross Section Evaluation Working Group (CSEWG) in nuclear data evaluation that utilizes developments in nuclear theory, modeling, simulation, and experiment. The principal advances in the new library are: (1) An increase in the breadth of neutron reaction cross section coverage, extending from 393 nuclides to 423 nuclides; (2) Covariance uncertainty data for 190 of the most important nuclides, as documented in companion papers in this edition; (3) R-matrix analyses of neutron reactions on light nuclei, including isotopes of He, Li, and Be; (4) Resonance parameter analyses at lower energies and statistical high energy reactions for isotopes of Cl, K, Ti, V, Mn, Cr, Ni, Zr and W; (5) Modifications to thermal neutron reactions on fission products (isotopes of Mo, Tc, Rh, Ag, Cs, Nd, Sm, Eu) and neutron absorber materials (Cd, Gd); (6) Improved minor actinide evaluations for isotopes of U, Np, Pu, and Am (we are not making changes to the major actinides 235,238U and 239Pu at this point, except for delayed neutron data and covariances, and instead we intend to update them after a further period of research in experiment and theory), and our adoption of JENDL-4.0 evaluations for isotopes of Cm, Bk, Cf, Es, Fm, and some other minor actinides; (7) Fission energy release evaluations; (8) Fission product yield advances for fission-spectrum neutrons and 14 MeV neutrons incident on 239Pu; and (9) A new decay data sublibrary. Integral validation testing of the ENDF/B-VII.1 library is provided for a variety of quantities: For nuclear criticality, the VII.1 library maintains the generally-good performance seen for VII.0 for a wide range of MCNP simulations of criticality benchmarks, with improved performance coming from new structural material evaluations, especially for Ti, Mn, Cr, Zr and W. For Be we see some improvements although the fast assembly data appear to be mutually inconsistent. Actinide cross section updates are also assessed through comparisons of fission and capture reaction rate measurements in critical assemblies and fast reactors, and improvements are evident. Maxwellian-averaged capture cross sections at 30 keV are also provided for astrophysics applications. We describe the cross section evaluations that have been updated for ENDF/B-VII.1 and the measured data and calculations that motivated the changes, and therefore this paper augments the ENDF/B-VII.0 publication [M.

	abstract = {Compressible fluid dynamics is of great practical interest in many industrial applications, ranging from chemistry to aeronautical industry, and to nuclear field as well. At the same time, modelling and simulation of compressible flows is a very complex task, requiring the development of specific approaches, in order to describe the effect of pressure on the fluid velocity field. Compressibility effects become even more important in the study of two-phase flows, due to the presence of a gaseous phase. In addition, compressibility is also expected to have a significant impact on other physics, such as chemical or nuclear reactions occurring in the mixture. In this perspective, multiphysics represents a useful approach to address this complex problem, providing a way to catch all the different physics that come into play as well as the coupling between them. In this work, a multiphysics model is developed for the analysis of the generation IV Molten Salt Fast Reactor (MSFR), with a specific focus on the compressibility effects of the fluid that acts as fuel in the reactor. The fuel mixture compressibility is expected to have an important effect on the system dynamics, especially in very rapid super-prompt-critical transients. In addition, the presence of a helium bubbling system used for online fission product removal could modify the fuel mixture compressibility, further affecting the system transient behaviour. Therefore, the MSFR represents an application of concrete interest, inherent to the analysis of compressibility effects and to the development of suitable modelling approaches. An OpenFOAM solver is developed to handle the fuel compressibility, the presence of gas bubbles in the reactor as well as the coupling between the system neutronics and fluid dynamics. The outcomes of this analysis point out that the fuel compressibility plays a crucial role in the evolution of fast transients, introducing delays in the expansion feedbacks that strongly affect the system dynamics. Moreover, it is found that the gas bubbles significantly alter the fuel compressibility, yielding even larger differences compared to the incompressible approximation usually adopted in the current MSFR solvers.},

To further develop these MSR concepts, researchers need simulation tools for analyzing liquid-fueled MSR depletion and fuel processing. However, most contemporary nuclear reactor physics software is unable to perform high-fidelity full-core depletion calculations for a reactor design with online reprocessing. This paper introduces a Python package, SaltProc, which couples with the Monte Carlo code, SERPENT2 to simulate MSR online reprocessing by modeling the changing isotopic composition of MSR fuel salt. This work demonstrates SaltProc capabilities for a full-core, high-fidelity model of the commercial Molten Salt Breeder Reactor (MSBR) concept and verifies these results to results in the literature from independent, lower-fidelity analyses.},

The new module is successfully tested against a Monte Carlo model of the MSFR, in order to assess its correct implementation. Then, a neutronics analysis of the MSFR is carried out on a simplified axial-symmetric model of the reactor. Particular focus is devoted to the analysis of the MSFR helium bubbling system and its effect on reactivity. The presence of bubbles inside the reactor is handled with a two-fluid thermal-hydraulics module, previously implemented into the solver. The void reactivity coefficient is evaluated on the basis of the bubble spatial distribution calculated by the multiphysics solver. Then, the results are compared to simulations carried out with uniform bubble distributions, highlighting significant differences between the two approaches. The outcomes of this work constitute a step forward in the multiphysics analysis of the Molten Salt Fast Reactor and represent a useful starting point for the optimization of the MSFR helium bubbling system, as well as for the development of appropriate control strategies.},

All three compositions were covered by the present benchmark. The calculations have confirmed that the MSFR has very favorable characteristics not present in other Gen4 fast reactors, like strong negative temperature and void reactivity coefficients, a low-fissile inventory, a reduced long-lived waste production and its burning capacities of nuclear waste produced in currently operational reactors.},

	abstract = {The Molten Salt Fast Reactor (MSFR) has garnered much interest for its inherent safety and sustainbility features. The MSFR can adopt a closed thorium fuel cycle for sustainable operation through the breeding of 233 U from 232 Th. The fuel composition changes significantly over the course of its lifespan. In this study, we investigated the steady state and transient behavior of the MSFR using Moltres, a coupled neutronics/thermal-hydraulics code developed within the Multiphysics Object Oriented Simulation Environment (MOOSE) framework. Three different fuel compositions, start-up, early-life, and equilibrium, were examined for potentially dangerous core temperature excursions during a unprotected loss of heat sink (ULOHS) accident. The six-group and total neutron flux distributions showed good agreement with SERPENT and published MSFR results, while the temperature distribution and total power showed discrepancies which can be attributed toknown sources of error. For the transient behavior under the ULOHS scenario, while the transition time towards the new steady state core temperature is also in good agreement with existing MSFR simulations by Fiorina et al., Moltres under-estimated the temperature rise by a factor of ten, due to the same sources of error affecting the steady state results. While an MSFR loaded with start-up fuel composition operates at a higher temperature than with the other two fuel compositions, all three cases were shown to be inherently safe due to thestrong negative temperature feedback.},

	abstract = {Salt reactors are liquid fuel reactors so that they are flexible in operation, but they are very different from solid fuel reactors in the approach to safety. This study concentrates on the specific concept named Molten Salt Fast Reactor (MSFR). Since this new nuclear technology is in development, safety is an essential point to be considered all along the research and development studies. After a short description of the MSFR systems, necessary to device accidental scenarios, this paper will focus on the decay heat evaluation of such a reactor. Among different contributions, the decay heat of fission products in the MSFR is evaluated to be low (3\% of nominal power), mainly due to the reprocessing during the reactor operation. As a result, the contribution of the actinides is significant (0.5\% of nominal power). However, the decay heat of the fission products is important, and among the different uncertainty sources, the fission yield uncertainties are pointed out. The unprotected loss of heat sink transients are studied in this paper. It appears that slow transients are favorable ( {\textgreater}1 min) to minimize the temperature increase of the fuel salt. This work will be the basis of further safety studies as well as an essential parameter for the design of the draining system.},

	abstract = {Molten salt reactors, in the configuration presented here and called Thorium Molten Salt Reactor (TMSR), are particularly well suited to fulfil the criteria chosen by the Generation IV forum, and may be operated in simplified and safe conditions in the Th/233U fuel cycle with fluoride salts. Amongst all MSR configurations in the thorium cycle, many studies have highlighted the configurations with no moderator in the core as simple and very promising. Since 233U does not exist on earth and is not being produced today, we aim at designing a critical MSR able to burn the Plutonium and the Minor Actinides produced in the current operating reactors, and consequently to convert this Plutonium into 233U. This leads to closing the current fuel cycle thanks to TMSRs started with transuranic elements on a Thorium base, i.e. started in the Th/Pu fuel cycle, similarly to fast neutron reactors operated in the U/Pu fuel cycle. We will detail optimizations of this transition between the reactors of second and third generations to the Thorium cycle. Such a transition is based on a fleet of TMSRs with no moderator in the core, including TMSRs started with Plutonium and TMSRs directly started with 233U. We developed parametric studies to optimize these TMSRs, amongst which the study presented here, based on one of the main TMSR parameters: the percentage of heavy nuclei in the fuel salt of the TMSR configuration, which modifies the moderation ratio of the reactor and thus influences both the initial fissile inventory and the spectrum of the reactor. We analyze the characteristics of each reactorconfiguration, in terms of deterministic safety parameters, fissile matter inventory, salt reprocessing, radiotoxicity and waste production, and finally deployment capacities.},

Existing benchmarks are meant for single-physics codes, while experimental data for validation are absent. This is concerning, given the importance numerical simulations have in the development of fast MSR designs. Here, we propose the use of a coupled numerical benchmark specifically designed to assess the physics-coupling capabilities of the aforementioned codes. The benchmark focuses on the specific characteristics of fast MSRs and features a step-by-step approach, where physical phenomena are gradually coupled to easily identify sources of error. We collect and compare the results obtained during the benchmarking campaign of four multi-physics tools developed within the SAMOFAR project. Results show excellent agreement for all the steps of the benchmark. The benchmark generality and the broad spectrum of results provided constitute a useful tool for the testing and development of similar multi-physics codes.},

	abstract = {Thermal hydraulic analysis of nuclear reactor core is mainly performed using the sub-channel analysis codes to estimate different thermal hydraulic safety margins. The safety margins and the operating power limits of nuclear reactor core under different conditions of primary system i.e. system pressure, coolant inlet temperature, coolant flow rate and thermal power and its distributions are considered as the key parameters for sub-channel analysis. Considering the complexity of rod bundle geometry, different turbulent scales and due to their limitations of computational resources, performing the full scale computational fluid dynamic (CFD) analysis of nuclear reactor core is a cumbersome and time consuming task. Hence, the thermal hydraulic safety margins of most of the reactors operating in the world are carried out using the sub-channel analysis codes. In these codes, the governing equations of mass, momentum and energy are solved in control volumes which are connected in both radial and axial directions. The flow distributions in the rod bundle geometry are estimated by considering lateral momentum balance and the inter channel mixing models to account for the cross flow between the adjacent sub-channels. The accurate estimations of the local conditions of the sub-channels are required to predict fuel temperature, critical heat flux ratio (CHFR) and critical power ratio (CPR). In this paper, various experiments conducted on the different geometries of sub-channels related inter sub-channel mixing in rod bundles are identified. A comprehensive review of sub-channel thermal hydraulic codes used for the analysis of nuclear reactor core is presented. This review covers various aspects of experimental, analytical and computational works related to rod bundles carried out in the past and brings out future directions derived from earlier research works.},

	abstract = {We discuss liquid-fuel molten salt (cooled) reactors (MSRs); how they will operate under normal, transient, and accident conditions; and the results of an expert elicitation to determine the corresponding thermal-hydraulic and neutronic phenomena important to understanding their behavior. Identifying these phenomena will enable the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), U.S. Department of Energy, and industry to develop or identify modeling functionalities and tools required to carry out confirmatory and licensing analyses that examine the validity and accuracy of an applicant’s calculations and help determine the margin of safety in plant design. The NRC frequently does an expert elicitation using a Phenomena Identification and Ranking Table (PIRT) to identify and evaluate the state of knowledge of important modeling phenomena. However, few details about the design of these reactors and the sequence of events during accidents are known, so the process used was considered a preliminary PIRT. A panel comprising a group of subject matter experts met to define phenomena that would need to be modeled and considered the impact/importance of each phenomenon with respect to specific figures of merit (FoMs) (e.g., salt temperature, velocity, and composition). Each FoM reflected a potential impact on radionuclide release or loss of a barrier to release. The panel considered what the path forward might be with respect to being able to model the phenomenon in a simulation code. Results are explained for both thermal and fast spectrum designs, with an emphasis on the thermal-hydraulic takeaways.It was concluded that compared to light water reactors, the lack of high-pressure operation, energetic break flow, depressurization, and quench front tracking may simplify some aspects of an MSR analysis. However, MSRs have new phenomena both for a license applicant and NRC confirmatory analysis. There is a need for enhanced understanding of physical properties for MSRs that encompass several individual thermophysical properties, including thermal conductivity, viscosity, specific heat, density, optical properties, thermodynamic properties, volatilities, solubilities, etc. Salt composition is closely linked to both these properties and the neutronics of the system. Additionally, the large number of MSR concepts and system designs means that there is wide variation in the potential modeling needs for these systems.},

	abstract = {In an operating nuclear reactor system, various physical phenomena of different properties are intimately linked. These multiphysics phenomena include neutronics (N), thermal-hydraulics (TH), materials science, and other subjects. Among them, the interaction between neutronics and thermal-hydraulics is of great significance in reactor design and safety analysis. In this work, different N/TH coupling methods are reviewed, including loose and tight coupling. For the studies on loose coupling, in which two physical fields are decoupled, the current research status is summarized and classified based on the coupling methods of neutronics and thermal-hydraulics. The studies of tight coupling are introduced based on multiphysics coupling platforms. The investigation shows that the number and objectives of loose coupling studies are more abundant and extensive than those of tight coupling. This indicates that loose coupling strategies are the mainstream coupling solutions in recent research. Furthermore, the solution approaches of N/TH coupling are reviewed with respect to the aspects of performance improvement and application studies, including the operator splitting (OS), Picard iteration, and Jacobian-Free Newton–Krylov (JFNK) methods. A comprehensive study of the solution approaches shows that most of the current loose coupling numerical simulations adopt the Picard iteration method, because it has higher calculation accuracy than the OS method. In contrast to the decoupling approaches such as the OS and Picard iteration methods, the JFNK method updates all physical quantities synchronously, which makes it more accurate. Hence, there are broad application prospects for N/TH tight coupling of the JFNK method.},
